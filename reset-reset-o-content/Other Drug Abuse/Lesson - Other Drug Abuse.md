# Lesson - Other Drug Abuse

## Screen 1
Many people who are addicted to opiates also abuse other drugs.  For example, about 60% of opiate abusers are also addicted to alcohol.  Similarly about 30% of opiate abusers are also addicted to marijuana.  Many other people addicted to opiates also use these drugs but are not addicted to them.

## Screen 2
Some people increase their other drug use when they stop using opiates.  In other words, they switch to using other drugs instead of opiates.

## Screen 3
If someone continues to use other drugs while taking part in an opiate treatment program, it may lead to poor treatment results.  For example, it may make it more difficult to give up opiate use.  Therefore, any effective treatment for opiate addiction must also focus on other types of drug abuse.

## Screen 4
Many people who are addicted to opiates do not think of their use of alcohol or other drugs as a problem.  Some people do admit it is a problem, but still do not want to change their use of these drugs.  Being in treatment helps to maintain and support a person’s efforts to stop using opiates.  It may also motivate them to give up other drug use.

## Screen 5
Even if someone does not want to end their drug use during the early stages of treatment, they might change their mind later.  This may happen if they can’t stop using opiates while they keep using other drugs.

## Screen 6
For example, if a person typically used heroin and cocaine together, it may be very difficult to stop using one but not the other.  This is because the cocaine use reminds them of how they usually used heroin with it.  This creates a trigger that is hard to ignore.

## Screen 7
When someone successfully stops using opiates, they can see the positive results in their life.  In turn, this may give them a reason to try ending other drug use.

## Screen 8
Sometimes people look forward to the positive effects of giving up opiate use, but find that they can’t meet their goals unless their other drug use stops too.  The other drug use may get in the way of making lifestyle changes because of hangovers, low energy levels, or too little time for positive social activities.

## Screen 9
The use of other drugs may cause negative outcomes, such as an arrest for drunk driving or a possession of marijuana charge.  This may also make a person more motivated to stop using that drug.

## Screen 10
Very few people who are addicted to opiates can make progress in ending their opiate use unless they stop using other drugs.

## Screen 11
Research has shown that even low amounts of alcohol can make a person want to use cocaine more than they want to spend time in non-drug related activities.  This may happen with other drug use as well.

## Screen 12
People who stop using opiates but regularly use other drugs are likely to live or spend time near a place where opiates are easily available.  They also may remain friends with people who use opiates and other drugs.  This makes it difficult for them to begin new social activities with non-drug using friends.

## Screen 13
If a person is abusing other drugs, this can prevent them from creating a stable lifestyle, which is important to help them stay clean from opiates.  For example, if a person gets drunk often, it is unlikely that their family relationships will improve.  They won’t be able to keep a stable job.  They also will not have the time or energy to do activities unrelated to alcohol use.

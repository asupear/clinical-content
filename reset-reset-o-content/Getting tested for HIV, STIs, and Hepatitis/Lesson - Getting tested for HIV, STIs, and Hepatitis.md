# Lesson - Getting Tested for HIV, STIs, and Hepatitis

## Screen 1
While HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and hepatitis can all have signs and symptoms, the only way to tell for sure if you have HIV, STIs or hepatitis is to get tested. The sooner you know that you have HIV or an STI, the sooner you can start taking care of yourself to minimize its impact on your life, and start protecting sexual partners from getting infected.

## Screen 2
Getting tested for HIV, STIs and/or hepatitis can be scary, but there are things that you can do to make it easier. Choose a place for testing where you feel comfortable and respected, and bring along a close friend, parent or sibling for support. There are clinics that see only teens and young adults, many of which offer free HIV, STI and hepatitis testing.

## Screen 3
The health care provider or counselor performing the test will ask you some questions about why you want to get tested and what might have put you at risk. He or she will also explain how the test works and talk with you about how to reduce your risk in the future and how to treat and cope with the infection if you have one.

## Screen 4
It can take several days or up to several weeks to get results back from tests. This waiting time can be stressful, so make sure you have someone to talk to for support while waiting for your results.

## Screen 5
Your health care provider will explain the meaning of results of any tests you have had. Generally, a positive test result means that you have the infection that was tested for, and a negative result means that you do not have the infection that was tested for. No lab tests are 100% accurate, so there can be false positives and false negatives. You can ask the health care provider or counselor how accurate the specific test you are having is.

## Screen 6
All testing for HIV, STIs and hepatitis can be done confidentially. Confidential testing means that there is a record of the test and result with your name on it, and health care providers and counselors are required by law to keep the information in the record private.

## Screen 7
There can be circumstances where the health care provider or counselor is required by law to report the results of your test to the state or to a court of law. One reason for this is it lets the state know how many people have certain infections so that they can focus prevention and treatment efforts as effectively as possible to areas that need them the most.

## Screen 8
Sometimes testing can be done anonymously. Anonymous testing means that your name, address, and other identifying information are not recorded anywhere. With anonymous testing, you are usually assigned a number code that you need to keep and present when you return to get your result. HIV testing can often be done anonymously.

## Screen 9
The tests for each type of STI vary. Some are blood tests, some are urine tests, and some require a swab or sample from the urethra, cervix, mouth, or an open sore that could be caused by a STI (like herpes).

## Screen 10
Testing for hepatitis A, B and C starts with a blood test, and if positive, may require follow-up testing to determine if you were infected in the past and the infection is cleared, or whether you still have the virus in your body. If you have tested positive for hepatitis, there are also tests that can be done to check the effects, if any, of the hepatitis on your liver.

## Screen 11
HIV testing can be particularly difficult because of the seriousness of the disease and the stigma that is unfortunately still associated with it. But if you have done anything that might have put you at risk, it is important to get tested so that if you have HIV you can start treatment and you can avoid passing it on to other people. If you donâ€™t have HIV, you can learn more about how to reduce your risk of getting it in the future.

## Screen 12
The tests that are used to tell if you have been infected with HIV are called antibody tests. They are looking for antibodies to HIV, which is how the immune system reacts when the body is infected with a virus. HIV tests can be done with a sample of blood, urine or oral fluid.

## Screen 13
It can take anywhere from 6 weeks to 6 months after being infected with HIV for your body to have enough antibodies to show up on a test. This period of time is often called the window period. In order for the test to be accurate, it is recommended that you wait to get tested until 3-6 months after you did something that might have put you at risk.

## Screen 14
During the window period, people with HIV can still pass the virus on to other people, even if they have not yet tested positive for HIV. Someone infected with HIV can infect other people right away, even though they may not yet know that they have HIV.

## Screen 15
It can take a few days and up to a couple of weeks to get your HIV test results. Many places require that you go back in person to get the result. This way you can talk with a health care provider or counselor again for support, information, and if HIV positive, referrals for treatment and other useful services and support.

## Screen 16
If the result is negative, that means that either you are not infected with HIV, or it is too early to tell. If the result is positive, it means that you have been infected with HIV and can pass it on to other people. In rare cases, the result may be indeterminate or uncertain. If this happens, it will be recommended that you get tested again.

## Screen 17
If your results for any STI tests, including HIV, are positive it is important to get see a health care provider as quickly as possible. There may be treatments that can cure the infection (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis), or help you to manage it as best as possible if there is no cure (human papilloma virus, herpes, HIV, hepatitis).

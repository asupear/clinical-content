# Lesson - Living with HIV: Implementing Daily Routines to Promote Health

## Screen 1
Once you know that you have HIV, there are things that you can do on a daily basis to try to stay as healthy as possible.

## Screen 2
The first step in managing HIV is to see a health care provider who has experience treating the virus. Your health care provider can assess the health of your immune system (the system of the body that fights disease), and recommend which treatment options might be best for you. It is important to let your health care provider know about any medications, herbs, vitamins, alcohol and other drugs that you are using.

## Screen 3
In addition to medications, there are other things you can do to feel as healthy as possible and minimize the effects of HIV on your body. These include a healthy diet, exercise, getting enough sleep, reducing stress and avoiding alcohol and other harmful drugs.

## Screen 4
Eating a healthy diet can give you energy to get through the day and can help you maintain your weight. Some of the medications that are used to treat HIV can cause a loss of appetite, nausea and/or diarrhea, but it is important to try to eat small, healthy meals throughout the day. Talk to your health care provider before using any herbal or vitamin supplements to find out how they might interact with any medications you are taking.

## Screen 5
Try to find activities that you enjoy and that help relieve your stress. Exercise can help increase your energy level and help you to feel better about yourself. Exercise doesn’t have to be strenuous to feel the benefits; even going for a walk every day can help. Some people find therapies such as yoga and meditation to be helpful in managing stress as well as the symptoms of HIV and side effects from the medications.

## Screen 6
Try to get enough sleep each night so that you feel rested. Many people with HIV experience fatigue and find it necessary and helpful to rest throughout the day as well. If you are experiencing insomnia or difficulty sleeping, talk to your health care provider about possible solutions.

## Screen 7
The use alcohol and other drugs may make it harder for people with HIV to stay healthy, may make it difficult to stay on your medication schedule, and may put you at risk for other viruses such as hepatitis B and C. In addition, if you are sharing drug equipment, you may be putting other people at risk for getting HIV. The best thing you could do for your health is to stop using drugs and alcohol. If you continue to use drugs, do not share any drug equipment because it might have blood on it.

## Screen 8
You may want to consider getting vaccinated for hepatitis A and B, if you have not already. Having HIV is stressful to your body and can be further complicated by co-infection with another harmful virus. In addition, you may want to get immunizations (shots) to prevent pneumonia and flu.

## Screen 9
Because HIV affects your immune system’s ability to fight infection, there are certain precautions you will want to take to protect your health when preparing food, being around pets and other animals, and traveling. Your health care provider can give you more information on these issues.

## Screen 10
You can take control over your own health by implementing healthy daily habits, learning everything that you can about HIV, finding support from others, and seeing your health care provider regularly. You can live a long, healthy life with HIV, but it requires you to take good care of yourself.

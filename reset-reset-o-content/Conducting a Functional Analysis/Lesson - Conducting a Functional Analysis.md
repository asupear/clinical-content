# Lesson - Conducting a Functional Analysis

## Screen 1
The first step in doing a functional analysis of your drug use is to identify situations that function as triggers.

An easy way to identify your pattern of drug use is to complete a functional analysis of your drug use.

Think of the **last time** you used drugs.

Try to remember what you were doing just before you used drugs in order to understand the triggers of your drug use.

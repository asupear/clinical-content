# Lesson - Taking Responsibility for Choices

## Screen 1
You may sometimes hear people say “I couldn’t help it” when they are talking about decisions they made to have risky sex or use drugs or alcohol. The fact is that in most situations we do have choices about what we do and don’t do.

## Screen 2
The exception to this is when someone else forces you to do something through abuse or violence. This can happen when there is not equal power between the people involved. If you think you may be in an abusive relationship or have been the victim of dating violence, there are people that can help. The national domestic violence hotline number is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233), and their website is <a href='http://www.ndvh.org'>www.ndvh.org</a>. For the remainder of this discussion, we will assume that there is no abuse or violence happening in the situations we are discussing.

## Screen 3
You may not set out to do something risky, but the choices that you make every day about things that seem to have nothing to do with risky sex or drug and alcohol use may lead you to a situation where you are faced with a choice about a risky activity. All of these day-to-day decisions that seem unimportant can bring you closer and closer to a risky situation.

## Screen 4
Let’s look at an example.

Maria, 17, just completed a month-long treatment program for her problem with alcohol. She is now living with her parents and is hoping to finish school so she can get a job and move out on her own. She knows that she needs to stay sober in order to make this happen, and she really wants to succeed.

## Screen 5
One day after school she goes to the mall to buy some new clothes for school. While there, she runs into Rick, someone she used to drink with. Rick tells her that a group of her old buddies are hanging out at their friend Carlos’ house and invites her to come over. She says maybe she will and he leaves.

## Screen 6
She thinks to herself that she hasn’t seen her old buddies in a while, and she could just stop by and say hi and only stay for a minute. Besides, she told Rick that she might, so she doesn’t want to disappoint him. She decides to buy clothes another day, leaves the mall and goes to Carlos’ house.

## Screen 7
When she gets there, she sees that everyone is drinking. The people there seem really happy to see her, and they ask her to come in and hang out for a while. She likes the attention she is getting, and decides to stay for a while.

## Screen 8
It doesn’t take long for someone to offer her a beer, and she decides that she could have just one. She ends up having several beers and starts fooling around with one of the guys who she used to go out with. She ends up having sex with him, and he doesn’t wear a condom. She leaves after a couple of hours and goes home. The next day, she feels really badly that she drank, and is scared about the fact that she had sex without a condom.

## Screen 9
Think about some of the decisions that Maria made that seemed unimportant or unrelated to alcohol use and risky sex at the time.

- What else could she have said to Rick at the mall?
- What could she have done instead of go to Carlos’ house?
- Once there, did she have to stay?

## Screen 10
Many of the choices that Maria made that afternoon may have seemed minor at the time, but in the end they led her to a situation where she was being offered alcohol and having unprotected sex. The decision to go to Carlos’ house may have seemed insignificant at the time, but it led Maria to having to make a more difficult decision about whether or not to drink.

## Screen 11
Thinking through the different options you have and the possible consequences before making any decision, large or small, can help you to avoid getting into situations where you may be likely to use drugs or alcohol, and/or engage in risky sex.

## Screen 12
It is also helpful to know what your triggers or influences are, so that you can think through your options and whether they will put you in a situation where you are faced with one or more of your triggers. For example, Maria might have known that being with this group of people was a trigger for her to drink, because she used to drink with them before. She could have thought about this when making her decision to go to Carlos’ house and may have recognized that choosing to go there might put her in a situation where she would have to decide whether or not to drink alcohol.

## Screen 13
Remember that you are the only one who is responsible for what you do and don’t do. It may be hard at first, but with practice, the thinking and planning ahead will happen automatically and you will feel more control over your ability to stay healthy and avoid risk.

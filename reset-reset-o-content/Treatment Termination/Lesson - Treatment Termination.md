# Lesson - Treatment Termination

## Screen 1
Today’s session will focus on the ending of your treatment.  Since you have been in treatment for many months, it is important to think about and plan for the time when you will no longer be attending treatment.

## Screen 2
Many people have difficulty ending close relationships.  For many months you have been coming to the treatment center.  You may or may not have developed a close relationship with the treatment center staff, therapists, and other clients.  There are two aspects we will focus on today: managing feelings about ending treatment and making a follow-up plan.

## Screen 3
As you have learned throughout your treatment, major events, both positive and negative, can be disruptive and lead to a relapse.  However, recognizing major events, and planning for them can often prevent a relapse.

## Screen 4
In order to cope with the feelings and thoughts that may arise around your treatment ending, you must first identify what feelings and thoughts you are experiencing.  Many people have a range of feelings.

You may be happy to have more free time when you stop coming to the clinic.   You may be sad to say good-bye to people you know at the clinic.  At the same time, you may be scared about what will happen after you end treatment.

## Screen 5
As you have already learned in earlier skills trainings, the first step in managing feelings is to become aware of them.  Identify your feelings and thoughts about treatment ending.

Next, it will be important to express these different thoughts and feelings with your therapist in your final sessions.  In these final sessions, you and your therapist can plan together to ease your transition out of treatment.

## Screen 6
The second part of termination is to develop a follow-up plan.  You may want to arrange for additional drug or alcohol counseling.  Finding support groups or having a list of resources may also be helpful.

Most people need some kind of continued support after treatment.  Supportive people can help you maintain the lifestyle changes that you have made while in treatment and help you remain opioid-free.

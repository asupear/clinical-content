# Lesson - Relationship Counseling Part 3

## Screen 1
Communication Skills: Improving Communication with Your Partner: Part 3

In this section of the program, you will be presented with skills that address conflict you may have with a partner. Arguing can occur when effective communication skills are not being used. For example, if you do not stay on a specific topic or bring up every little thing that bothers you, this can cause problems. If you call your partner names or raise issues at inappropriate times, it might lead to an argument.

## Screen 2
Arguments are defined as bringing up issues without discussion or resolution. It doesnâ€™t matter if you are yelling at each other or not, if the problem or issue is not resolved, it is an argument.

## Screen 3
The first step in gaining control of arguing behavior is to know your pattern of arguing. It is important that you learn to foresee arguments.

Make a list of what situations typically result in arguments with your partner. They may happen at stressful times, like the holidays, or when you are having financial trouble. Being aware of these situations can help you prevent them or handle them differently.

## Screen 4
Avoidance is another type of problem that can happen in relationships. Some couples practically never argue, they totally avoid conflict by never talking about issues. In this situation, either one partner usually gives in all the time or both become good at ignoring all issues that arise.

## Screen 5
Not discussing problems or concerns usually results in one or both partners feeling resentful, unloved, or upset. It is important to recognize what issues are critical and to communicate these complaints to your partner at an appropriate time.

## Screen 6
Sometimes it is hard to know if you and your partner are having problems with avoidance. Some clues or signals that avoidance may be a problem include:

a. You think there is no conflict at all in your relationship.
b. Conversations tend to be dull and routine. You feel disconnected.
c. You feel that certain topics cannot be raised because they will start an argument or result in negative outcomes.
d. You feel so resentful towards your partner that you do not want to do special favors for him or her.

## Screen 7
You should try to use the information that you learned in this section of the program to understand the nature of arguing and avoidant behavior. Apply it to communicating with your partner, if appropriate.

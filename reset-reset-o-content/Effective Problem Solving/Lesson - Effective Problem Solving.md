# Lesson - Effective Problem Solving

## Screen 1
The goal of this section of the program is to teach you to identify, analyze, and solve problems you may face. Becoming good at problem solving usually takes a lot of practice.

## Screen 2
The basic steps for problem solving are:

1. Recognizing the problem
2. Identifying the problem
3. Brainstorming solutions
4. Selecting the solution
5. Evaluating its effectiveness

## Screen 3
Recognizing the problem involves increasing your awareness of problem situations when you face them. The following sources may provide you with some clues that a problem exists.

- Your body (e.g., tension, craving)
- Your thoughts and feelings (e.g., worry, depressed, lonely, irritable).
- Your behavior (poor work performance, not meeting responsibilities in your family, with friends).
- Your reactions to other people (e.g., irritable, lack of interest, isolation) 
- Othersâ€™ reactions to you (e.g., avoidance, complaining)

## Screen 4
Identifying the problem involves learning to clearly describe or identify a problem once you realize that something is wrong.

## Screen 5
You should collect as much information and as many facts as possible to help you describe the problem clearly. Work on breaking down the problem into manageable parts.

## Screen 6
For example, if you are upset about your current job and are considering quitting, you must clearly describe why the job is problematic before you can solve the problem.

You could ask yourself the following questions:
"Do I get along with my coworkers?" ; "How is my relationship with my supervisor?" ; "Have I received any negative feedback on evaluations?" ; "Is the pay high enough?; Have I asked for a raise?"

You should ask detailed questions as you focus on the problem.

## Screen 7
Brainstorming solutions stresses that it is important for you to develop several solutions to the problem, because the first solution you think of may not be the most effective solution.

## Screen 8
When brainstorming, you should list all possible solutions without evaluating them.

You should list ridiculous along with serious solutions, difficult as well as the easy solutions, and the worst along with the best solutions.

## Screen 9
Selecting a solution involves choosing the single most promising solution to the problem.

You should evaluate each potential solution and identify the most likely outcomes for each solution.

Be sure to consider both positive and negative outcomes and both long-term and short-term consequences for each solution.

## Screen 10
Also, evaluate the difficulty of carrying out each solution. You may use a scale to assign a difficulty rating, or number value to each solution.

You should decide which solution to try first only after considering both the *ease of implementing* the solution and the chances for a positive outcome.

## Screen 11
Evaluating the effectiveness of the solution means that after you choose a solution, you must use it, then judge whether it helped you solve your problem effectively.

At this stage, it is important for you to evaluate how effective the solution was, and to try again if it was ineffective.

## Screen 12
In addition, it is important for you to determine how to judge if a solution is effective. For example, you may ask yourself "What specifically will change in my situation when I solve this problem?"

Determining this ahead of time will help you to be more realistic and perhaps optimistic about finding effective solutions to problems.

## Screen 13
These strategies for problem-solving will become easier and more automatic for you if you practice them regularly when working on solving a problem.

Remember to work through the problem recognition stage to identify specific problems you would like to address. Then describe a problem as accurately as possible, brainstorm solutions, assess alternative solutions, and select a solution. After you select a solution and carry it out, be sure to evaluate your solution to determine how effective it was.

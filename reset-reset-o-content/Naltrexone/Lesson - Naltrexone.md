# Lesson - Naltrexone

## Screen 1
This section of the program will address facts about Naltrexone treatment. Naltrexone is an extremely safe medication that promotes recovery.

## Screen 2
The medication, Naloxone (or its tradename, Narcan), may sound more familiar to you than Naltrexone. Naloxone has been used in emergency rooms to save the lives of people who have taken an overdose of opiates. Naltrexone is a longer acting form of the same medication.

## Screen 3
**Facts about Relapse and Recovery**
1. The average opioid-dependent person seeks drug treatment an average of 4 times in their lifetime.
2. Relapse rates after treatment are high. Many people relapse after treatment, and this often happens during the first three (3) months after leaving treatment.

## Screen 4
**Facts about Relapse and Recovery (Continued)**
3. Once a person completes opiate detoxification treatment, they are entering one of the most risky periods for relapse.
4. Naltrexone can prevent relapse after a person finishes a detoxification program. It can help fight the urge to use and will prevent a person from becoming physically dependent again.

## Screen 5
Naltrexone is a strong, long-lasting, man-made medication. It is a drug that blocks the effects of opioids such as heroin or Oxycodone. Naltrexone is taken orally (as a pill). In order to start taking Naltrexone, a person has to be opiate-free.

## Screen 6
If someone takes Naltrexone and then takes heroin, for example, he/she will not feel high from the heroin. Taking fifty milligrams (50 mg) of Naltrexone a day will block the effects of heroin for about 24 hours.

## Screen 7
Naltrexone affects the same part of the brain that opioids like heroin or Oxycodone affect. The Naltrexone blocks other opioids, so they cannot make a person feel high. Also, as long as a person takes Naltrexone, they cannot become re-addicted to opioids because they will not become physically dependent on opioids.

## Screen 8
If someone who is taking Naltrexone uses large amounts of street opiates this can be very dangerous. Trying to overcome Naltrexone’s blocking effect by taking large amounts of opioids could make someone go into a coma or die from breathing problems.

## Screen 9
The longer a person is able to stay clean from opioids, the greater the chance that they will avoid relapse. If a person stays abstinent from opioids for a long period of time, they will be able to learn and practice recovery skills. This means they will have better odds for long-term recovery.

## Screen 10
Naltrexone is a very safe and effective medication and has almost no side effects (as long as a person is opiate-free when they start taking Naltrexone). Most clients who are abstinent from opioids do not feel any side effects from Naltrexone. Also, a person cannot become physically addicted to the Naltrexone. A person can stop taking it at any time without risk.

## Screen 11
A person will not get sick from opioids if they are taking Naltrexone. It only blocks the effects of the opioids. Naltrexone is sometimes confused with disulfiram, or Antabuse. Disulfiram makes people sick if they drink alcohol after taking the medication. Again, a person will not get sick if they use street opiates after taking Naltrexone. Rather, Naltrexone will simply prevent the person from feeling the effects of the opiates.

## Screen 12
If a person needs emergency pain medication while they were taking Naltrexone, they could still be treated with many types of non-narcotic medications. These alternatives are very effective in the treatment of pain.

## Screen 13
Also, as previously mentioned, a person can stop taking Naltrexone at any time without side effects. Each 50 mg tablet of naltrexone lasts about 24 hours. Therefore, if a person stopped taking Naltrexone, narcotic pain medication could be given if necessary, and the blocking effect of Naltrexone would eventually wear off.

## Screen 14
Naltrexone will typically not have a negative effect on a person’s liver. The liver is usually not affected by Naltrexone at the doses at which it is used. The liver can be checked regularly as a precaution when someone is taking Naltrexone. People who have Hepatitis C and who take Naltrexone should talk to a liver specialist and work closely with him/her.

## Screen 15
Some individuals report that taking Naltrexone can also decrease their cravings to use opioids. This is because they know if they were to use opioids that they wouldn’t feel anything. Therefore, they don’t think about using opioids as much and they experience fewer cravings while taking Naltrexone.

## Screen 16
Naltrexone can be given out at a treatment program or clinic, or prescribed by a medical doctor. It is affordable, especially compared to the money a person spends when he or she is abusing drugs.

## Screen 17
Naltrexone is a perfect solution for people who are serious about not relapsing and not becoming re-addicted to opiates. Naltrexone helps people take control of their recovery.

### Explanation
Naltrexone is a strong, long-lasting, man-made medication. It is a drug that blocks the effects of opioids such as heroin or Oxycodone. Naltrexone is taken orally (as a pill). In order to start taking Naltrexone, a person has to be opiate-free.

+ 72

### Explanation
If someone takes Naltrexone and then takes heroin, for example, he/she will not feel high from the heroin. Taking fifty milligrams (50 mg) of Naltrexone a day will block the effects of heroin for about 24 hours.

## Question 3

### Prompts - Multiple Choice
+ People who start taking Naltrexone when they are opioid-free __________.
+ If a person starts taking Naltrexone when they are clean from opioids, they will __________.
+ Starting Naltrexone after successfully detoxing from opioids will __________.

### Answers
+ __typically have a comfortable transition onto Naltrexone__
+ immediately experience many of the same side effects as withdrawal
+ become sick 24 hours later
+ have strong cravings for opioids for the first 24 hours

### Explanation
Naltrexone is a very safe and effective medication and has almost no side effects (as long as a person is opiate-free when they start taking Naltrexone). Most clients who are abstinent from opioids do not feel any side effects from Naltrexone. Also, a person cannot become physically addicted to the Naltrexone. A person can stop taking it at any time without risk.
A person will not get sick from opioids if they are taking Naltrexone. It only blocks the effects of the opioids. Naltrexone is sometimes confused with disulfiram, or Antabuse. Disulfiram makes people sick if they drink alcohol after taking the medication. Again, a person will not get sick if they use street opiates after taking Naltrexone. Rather, Naltrexone will simply prevent the person from feeling the effects of the opiates.

## Question 4

### Prompts - Multiple Choice
+ If a person uses street opiates while taking Naltrexone, they will __________.
+ If someone is taking Naltrexone and they use heroin, they will __________.
+ If someone uses heroin while they are on Naltrexone, they will __________.

### Answers
+ feel the effects of the opioids, but only a little bit
+ __not feel the effects of the opioids__
+ not feel the effects of the Naltrexone and probably relapse
+ become sick

### Explanation
Naltrexone affects the same part of the brain that opioids like heroin or Oxycodone affect. The Naltrexone blocks other opioids, so they cannot make a person feel high. Also, as long as a person takes Naltrexone, they cannot become re-addicted to opioids because they will not become physically dependent on opioids.
If someone who is taking Naltrexone uses large amounts of street opiates this can be very dangerous. Trying to overcome Naltrexoneâ€™s blocking effect by taking large amounts of opioids could make someone go into a coma or die from breathing problems.

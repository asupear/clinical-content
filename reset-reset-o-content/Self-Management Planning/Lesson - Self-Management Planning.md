# Lesson - Self-Management Planning

## Screen 1
Now that you have used functional analysis to identify the triggers and consequences of your drug use, you are going to learn strategies to help you cope with those triggers.

This program will teach you a strategy called “self-management planning”. As the name suggests, self-management planning involves finding high-risk situations that trigger you to use drugs, then planning to cope with those situations in advance so you can avoid using drugs when you face them.

## Screen 2
Self-Management training involves teaching you how to a) avoid your triggers for drug use, b) change your environment to reduce the chance that the trigger will occur, or c) develop new ways to cope with the trigger when it occurs.

## Screen 3
Before you continue with this program, take a moment to think about your most recently completed functional analysis forms. As you think about these forms on which you analyzed your most recent drug use, notice the following:

- External environmental events often trigger you to use drugs.

- For example, specific places, people, times of day, and activities can trigger you to use drugs. Take a moment now to review a specific trigger from your completed functional analysis worksheet.

## Screen 4
There are three basic ways of coping with these triggers to reduce your risk of using drugs.

One way you can cope is to *avoid coming into contact with the trigger*, or not facing it. For example, take a route home that is different from where you obtained drugs in the past, avoid going by your dealer’s house, don’t go into bars, and avoid people who you buy drugs from or use drugs with. For you to be successful at avoiding triggers, you must engage in new or different activities. For example, find new places to hang out or make new friends.

## Screen 5
A second way you can cope with triggers is by *rearranging your environment*. For example, don’t keep drugs, or drug paraphernalia (for example drug works) in the house, and don’t carry money with you if you know you will be passing places where you might be tempted to buy drugs.

## Screen 6
A third way you can cope with triggers is by *developing a plan that will help you not use when you face a trigger*. For example, if extra cash in your pocket is a trigger for you, then instead of using the money to buy drugs, use the money to engage in some incompatible behavior or one that prevents drug use. For example, you might call your spouse or do some activity that you enjoy, like exercising at a gym, shopping for something special for you or your family, or going to church.

## Screen 7
To help you devise a plan to cope with your triggers, you will be asked to complete a Self-Management Planning exercise at this time. The Self-Management Planning exercise will help you make a plan to cope with situations that may trigger you to use drugs.

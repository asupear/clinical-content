# Lesson - Living with HIV: Managing Treatment and Medications

## Screen 1
There are a number of medications that can help to keep someone living with HIV as healthy as possible. These medications are also known as drug therapy or antiretroviral therapy.

## Screen 2
The decision to start medications and manage their dosing schedule and side effects can be complicated. Find a health care provider who is an expert in treating HIV and with whom you feel comfortable to help you determine whether and when to start medications.

## Screen 3
Before starting on medications to treat HIV, your health care provider will do some tests to determine the health of your immune system, which is your body’s defense system against disease. These include a viral load test, which measures the amount of HIV in your blood, and a CD4 T cell count. The CD4 T cell is a type of white blood cell that fights infections. It is the type of cell that HIV destroys, making it harder for the body to fight infection. HIV medications can decrease your viral load and increase your CD4 T cell count, making your immune system stronger and better able to keep you healthy.

## Screen 4
Some things to consider when deciding whether or not to start medications include how advanced your HIV is, the results of your viral load test and CD4 T cell count, how you feel about taking medications, whether you can take them as prescribed, and whether you can tolerate the risks and potential side effects. It is also important to keep in mind that once you start medications, you may need to take them for the rest of your life. If you are pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, talk with your health care provider about the best treatment for you and your baby.

## Screen 5
Some of the more serious side effects that can occur on HIV medications include liver problems, diabetes, high cholesterol, decreased bone density, and skin rash. Many people also experience fever, nausea, diarrhea and fatigue. If you start medications, it is important to discuss any side effects that you have with your health care provider.

## Screen 6
Once you start medications, it is very important to take them when you are supposed to every day. When doses are skipped, even once, the virus takes the opportunity to multiply more rapidly, and may even become resistant to the medications you are taking.

## Screen 7
Some people with HIV may take many pills each day spread out over different times of the day. Some medications may need to be taken on an empty stomach, and some on a full stomach. It can be difficult for many people with HIV to adhere to or stay on their medication schedule because of the side effects, feeling sick or depressed, other things going on in their lives or simply forgetting to take them. There are several things you can do before starting treatment to help you stay on your medication schedule.

## Screen 8
Before starting medications, make sure you fully understand all of the benefits and potential risks and side effects, and make sure you understand the goals of the treatment. If you are fully informed about and committed to the plan, you are more likely to stick with the plan.

## Screen 9
Talk to your health care provider about any personal issues that may affect your ability to take the medications as prescribed. These may include cultural or religious beliefs about taking medications, problems taking medications in the past, substance use, an unstable living situation, mental illness, or major life crises.

## Screen 10
It can also be helpful to work your treatment plan around daily activities that you already do. Think about things you already do at the times you need to take your medications, like eating breakfast, brushing your teeth, watching a certain TV show. You can plan to take your medications before any of the activities you already do every day to help you remember.

## Screen 11
Once you and your health care provider have agreed on a treatment plan, ask for a written copy that outlines each medication, how much to take, and when to take it.

## Screen 12
Once you start taking medications, some people find it helpful to count out their doses in daily or weekly pill boxes to help keep track of them. Try to do this on the same day every week. Some people also use timers or alarms to remind them to take their medications. Other find it useful to have a support network of friends and family who can help remind them to take their medication.

## Screen 13
It is important to plan ahead for weekends, holidays, travel, or whenever your routines may be different. If you are going away or changing your daily schedule for any reason, make a plan ahead of time for how you are going to remember to take your medications. Call your health care provider or pharmacy well before you need a refill on your prescription to make sure that you don’t run out.

## Screen 14
Your health care provider will want to see you and conduct viral load tests and CD4 T cell counts about every few months to monitor the effects of treatment on your health. It is important to tell your health care provider about any side effects you are having, if you have skipped doses, or if you are having difficulty taking your medications for any reason.

## Screen 15
Taking HIV medications is not easy, but it can improve your health and quality of life. The more informed and committed you are, the more likely you are to be successful at managing your treatment.

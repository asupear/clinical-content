# Lesson - Giving and Receiving Compliments

## Screen 1
Giving and receiving compliments are important parts of healthy relationships. Giving compliments to another person and accepting compliments from another person can provide an honest connection between two individuals. Sharing thoughts and feelings can bring people closer to one another.

## Screen 2
The ability to give and receive compliments can be a difficult communication skill to develop. People may have a hard time giving compliments and/or receiving compliments.

## Screen 3
Some people may assume that another person already knows how they feel and may avoid giving positive comments to the other person. Failing to point out the positive aspects of others can make them feel taken-for-granted. Instead, by complimenting another person on their willingness to help you with a task or making a positive comment about the dinner they cooked for you lets them know that you appreciate them.

## Screen 4
If there is a lot of conflict in a relationship, compliments are usually overlooked. Relationship problems often occur when one is actively using drugs or alcohol. Arguments about the substance use, the money that is spent on substances or the lack of time spent together may take the place of positive comments.

## Screen 5
Showing appreciation for people who are supporting you through the recovery process increases the chance that they will continue to support you.

## Screen 6
There are specific skills involved in giving and receiving compliments.

## Screen 7
Compliments should be stated in terms of feelings rather than in terms of particular facts. Others may dispute a remark about a fact; however, they can not dispute your feelings. An example of this would be if you were to comment on a friend's outfit. Rather than stating, "I like your outfit", it would be harder for another person to dispute the compliment if you said, "I think you look really nice in that outfit. I like how the color of your shirt makes your eyes stand out."

## Screen 8
Similarly, when receiving a compliment from others, remember that a personâ€™s feelings are not right or wrong.

## Screen 9
Commenting on a specific event in addition to how it made you feel will let another person know that you have put thought into your comment. It is important to let another person know why you are complimenting them and what behavior triggered your comment. This will also make it more likely that they will continue these positive behaviors. For example, thanking a friend for baking you a birthday cake and letting them know that it made the day feel special shows them that their thoughtfulness had a positive impact on you. They will know that you appreciate that kind of gesture.

## Screen 10
Individuals frequently have difficulty accepting a compliment and tend to deny or dismiss positive feedback. People are often critical of themselves, which makes it hard to accept positive feedback from others.

## Screen 11
Rejecting a positive comment can make the person giving the compliment feel like their opinion is not valued, and they may interpret this response as an insult or a rejection.

## Screen 12
A gracious response such as, "thank you for your thoughts" shows that you appreciate another person's opinion, even if you do not agree with it.

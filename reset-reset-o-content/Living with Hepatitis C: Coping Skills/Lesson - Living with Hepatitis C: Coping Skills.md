Being told that you have hepatitis C can be a really big deal. People who have hepatitis C have many different feelings when they learn that they are infected including anger, surprise, confusion, hopelessness, sadness, and fear. There are lots of things that you can do to help deal with your feelings about having hepatitis C.

## Screen 2
You may be worried about telling other people about your hepatitis because of fear of how they will react. Who and when to tell is a decision that you need to make for yourself. It can be very helpful to have friends and loved ones who know that you have hepatitis and who can be supportive.

## Screen 3
It is also important to think about the possible negative consequences of telling people, such as being rejected, being treated differently, or potentially triggering anger or violence if you are telling someone who may have been put at risk. At the same time, it is important to notify people you have had unprotected sex or shared drug equipment with that they may have been put at risk. There are counselors and social workers who can help you figure out how and when to tell others.

It will be important to take precautions to make sure that you are not putting other people around you at risk for getting infected with hepatitis C. Make sure that you don’t share toothbrushes, razors or any other personal care items that may have blood on them.

Cover any cuts or open sores with a bandage until they have healed. Also practice safer sex with any sex partner. If you use drugs, try to stop.

You cannot give someone hepatitis C by hugging, sharing eating utensils, coughing, or kissing.

## Screen 6
It can be helpful to find someone that you trust who you can talk to about the feelings that you have about your hepatitis.

Signs of depression can include feeling sad or hopeless most of the time, moving slower than usual or feeling restless, losing interest in the things you normally enjoy, feeling tired most of the time, having a hard time concentrating, and thinking a lot about death. If you find that these feelings don’t go away or are getting worse, talk with a health care provider, counselor or social worker for help.

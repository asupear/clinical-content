# Lesson - Increasing Self-confidence In Decision-making

## Screen 1
Sometimes when you are learning something new or trying to change a behavior, it can be hard to believe that you really can do it, especially when you are faced with so many pressures, influences and triggers. It is important to remember that you are the only one who has the power to make a change in what you do.

## Screen 2
Think about the last time you tried to change something. Maybe you tried to lose weight, exercise more, or quit smoking. One of the things you might have done to help you reach your goal was to talk yourself through times when you were tempted to do what you were trying to stop doing, or you were tempted to go back to doing things the old way.

## Screen 3
The thoughts that you have can influence what you do or don’t do. When you are trying to develop new habits or skills, or give up unhealthy ones, what you tell yourself can make a difference. Positive thinking really does help.

## Screen 4
It can be helpful to tell yourself why the new or changed behavior is important to you. Think about the goals you have set for yourself. They may be things that will happen really soon (like being able to play in the game tomorrow, or being able to go to work this afternoon) or that will happen further into the future (like having children, going to college, or getting your own place to live).

## Screen 5
For example, if you are trying to start using condoms every time you have sex, you may say to yourself "It’s important for me to use condoms because I want to have kids someday. I need to stay healthy." Or, if you are trying to avoid using alcohol or drugs, you might say to yourself "I need to be able to stay drug-free so that I can keep my job."

## Screen 6
In addition, it is important to reassure yourself that you really can make the change. It is normal to have slips, or to go back to your old behaviors sometimes, but don’t let that stop you from continuing to work on your goal.

## Screen 7
If you have gone 10 days without doing the behavior you are trying to change, and have one day where you slip, that doesn’t erase the 10 days that you were successfully able to stop. Remind yourself that you have been successful with your behavior change and that you can continue to be successful.

## Screen 8
Another strategy to boost your confidence is to reward yourself with something when you are successful at making healthier choices. An example could be that if you follow through on your goal, you buy yourself a small present, or go out for ice cream. Thinking about the reward you will give yourself for reaching your goal can help you make it through the stress of making the change or decision.

## Screen 9
After a while, you won’t have to talk yourself through the change any longer because your new behavior will have become automatic. You will become good at whatever you learned to do differently, and you’ll be able to effectively respond to pressures and triggers much faster.

# Lesson - Living with HIV: Communication Skills for Disclosing HIV Status

## Screen 1
Telling others that you have HIV can be scary and very difficult, but keeping it a secret can be even harder. There are many benefits to sharing your HIV status with others. You may find support from family and friends that can strengthen your relationships. Disclosing your status to health care providers can help you receive the care that you need. And telling sexual partners can reduce the risk of transmitting the virus and can lead to healthier sexual relationships.

## Screen 2
Remember that you do not have to tell everyone; just those who you trust or need to tell, like health care providers, past or current sexual partners and/or people you have shared drug equipment with. Make sure that the people you tell understand that they need to protect and respect your privacy, and that you need to be able to choose who to tell and when.

## Screen 3
There can be some negative consequences of telling people about your HIV. Some may find it hard to accept and may become distant, or even cruel. Unfortunately, there is still a great deal of ignorance and stigma about HIV that can lead people to be judgmental and afraid. This can be very painful to deal with.

## Screen 4
You do not have to tell your boss or employer, but if you do, they are required by law not to share the information with anyone else. It is illegal to discriminate against someone in the workplace because they have HIV.

## Screen 5
While there is no easy way to tell someone close to you that you have HIV, there are some things you can do to prepare for the conversation that can help to make it easier.

## Screen 6
First think about why you want to tell the person you are thinking about telling. What do you expect or need from them? How do you hope they will react? What would be the worst possible reaction they could have?

## Screen 7
Next prepare yourself for the conversation. It can be helpful to have pamphlets, articles, phone numbers, website links and other information to leave with the person you are telling so that they can become informed and get the support that they might need.

## Screen 8
Think about where you want to tell the person. Choose a place where you feel safe and comfortable. It can also be helpful to choose a safe place to go after the conversation, like a close friend’s house, so you can get support afterward. You may even want to bring someone with you who knows about your HIV and is supportive.

## Screen 9
If possible, let the person you are telling know in advance that you need to meet with them to talk about something very important. This way they will be prepared for a serious discussion and the conversation won’t be rushed.

## Screen 10
Be optimistic that the person you are telling will react rationally and with support, but be prepared also to handle a negative reaction. Let them know that you are taking care of yourself and that what you need most from them is their love and support. If the conversation goes very badly, end the discussion and leave any materials you brought with them. Don’t try to persuade the person to think or feel differently right then.

## Screen 11
Give the person some time to digest the information you have given them. After some time has gone by, get in touch with them again to assess their reaction and answer any questions they might have.

## Screen 12
Many people who have HIV have found that they are surprised by how supportive people can be when they disclose their HIV status to them. Many say that they have found their relationships to be closer and stronger because of their honesty about their illness and their feelings about it, and that the relationships they lost as a result of disclosure were not strong ones to begin with.

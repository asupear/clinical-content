### Explanation
It was once thought that a spermicide called nonoxynol-9 provided extra protection against HIV infection. Studies have indicated that nonoxynol-9 does not provide any additional protection against HIV and STIs, and in fact it increased risk in some women who used it frequently (multiple times a day) because it caused irritation of the vagina which makes infection with HIV easier.

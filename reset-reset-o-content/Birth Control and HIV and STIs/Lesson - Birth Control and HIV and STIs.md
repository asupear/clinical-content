# Lesson - Birth Control and HIV and STIs

## Screen 1
Many young people who are sexually active are worried about pregnancy and want to do something to prevent getting pregnant. There are many different options available for birth control. As with prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the only sure way to prevent pregnancy is to avoid vaginal sex.

## Screen 2
If you do have vaginal sex, and are using or considering use of some method of birth control, it is important to be aware that most birth control methods do not provide protection against HIV and STIs.

## Screen 3
The only methods of birth control that provide effective protection against HIV and many STIs are latex condoms and female condoms. Other methods, such as birth control pills, Depo Provera®, Norplant ®, the IUD, and diaphragms, do not protect against HIV and STIs because they do not provide a barrier to prevent the exchange of the body fluids that can transmit some infections. If you or your partner is using any of these methods, you may want to consider using condoms or the female condom as well to help protect against infection with HIV or STIs.

## Screen 4
Spermicides are foams, creams, or suppositories that are inserted into the vagina before sex to prevent pregnancy. They work by immobilizing sperm (making them unable to travel to fertilize the egg). You may have heard that using spermicides or a condom that has spermicide on it can help prevent infection with HIV and STIs. This is NOT TRUE. Spermicides do not provide any additional protection against infection with HIV and STIs.

## Screen 5
It was once thought that a spermicide called nonoxynol-9 provided extra protection against HIV infection. Studies have indicated that nonoxynol-9 does not provide any additional protection against HIV and STIs, and in fact it increased risk in some women who used it frequently (multiple times a day) because it caused irritation of the vagina which makes infection with HIV easier.

## Screen 6
Choosing to have sex comes with the responsibility to deal with the risk of pregnancy and to protect yourself and your partner from potentially life-threatening infections. If you are having vaginal sex and want to prevent pregnancy, your health care provider can help you find a birth control method that is right for you, but also consider using condoms or female condoms to protect against infection with HIV and other STIs.

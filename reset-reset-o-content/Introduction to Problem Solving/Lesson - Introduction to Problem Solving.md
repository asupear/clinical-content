# Lesson - Introduction to Problem Solving

## Screen 1
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle involves finding solutions for many problems.

## Screen 2
For example, a direct goal like going to a job service center to meet with a job counselor and signing up for assistance in getting a job may require solving several problems.

You may not have transportation to the job service center, you may need childcare services, or the only available appointments may conflict with other important activities you have scheduled. In this example, such complications may make it difficult for you to go to the job service center.

## Screen 3
Ineffective problem solving skills usually result in negative consequences, which may worsen existing problems or create new ones.

## Screen 4
As a result, an important behavior to learn that will be relevant to virtually all that you do in your life, involves learning to effectively solve problems.

## Screen 5
The goal of this section of the program is to teach you to identify, analyze, and solve problems you may face.

## Screen 6
Certain difficult situations are challenging because their outcome depends upon the action that you choose. Problems arise from difficult situations when you do not respond to them effectively and make a choice that has a negative outcome.

## Screen 7
Some common problems encountered by individuals when making positive lifestyle changes include:

 - Difficulty finding the time to participate in social activities or hobbies
 - Lack of transportation
 - Problems with childcare
 - Job-related issues
 - Family pressures
 - Relationship problems

## Screen 8
Effective problem solving requires that you first recognize a difficult situation when you face one and then resist responding to the situation based on your first impulse or by doing nothing.

## Screen 9
If you do not effectively solve problems as you face them, your problems can build up over time, and this pressure may prevent you from maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

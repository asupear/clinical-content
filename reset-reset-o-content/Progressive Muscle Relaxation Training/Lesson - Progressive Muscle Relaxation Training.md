# Lesson - Progressive Muscle Relaxation Training

## Screen 1
In this section of the program, you will be guided through a tense-relax method called “progressive relaxation” or “deep muscle relaxation.”

## Screen 2
Progressive relaxation involves alternately tensing and relaxing various muscle groups in order to identify sensations of tension and replace them with sensations of relaxation.  The eight muscle groups are listed below:

1. Forearms
2. Biceps
3. Trapezius
4. Jaw
5. Eyes
6. Forehead
7. Stomach
8. Legs

## Screen 3
Recall that relaxation is a skill, which is learned gradually and with practice.  Nothing will be done to you. You will be in control and learn how to relax yourself.  It is important that you do not expect too much too soon.  It is quite possible that you will feel little effect the first few practice sessions, although some people do feel deeply relaxed the first time.

## Screen 4
This program will describe how to tense and relax each muscle group. You should carry out the behaviors as each one is described.  Before beginning, you should remember the following:

During the tension phase, try to produce a moderate amount of tension, try not to strain your muscles by tensing as hard as possible.

Release the tension immediately on cue, for example, as soon as the program prompts you to relax.

## Screen 5
Today you will practice while sitting upright in a chair in front of the computer monitor.  When practicing relaxation at home, you may lie on mats, blankets, or sit upright in a chair.

## Screen 6
Notice that the tense-relax cycle for each muscle group consists of:

1. Instructions describing how to tense each muscle.
2. Instructions to hold the tension.
3. Instructions to focus your attention on the tension sensations.
4. Instructions describing how to relax each muscle.
5. Instructions to focus your attention on the relaxed sensations and to notice the difference between tension and relaxation.

## Screen 7
We will proceed through eight muscle groups, first tensing each for a brief period, then relaxing each for a longer period.  Settle back as comfortably as you can, take a deep breath, and exhale very slowly.

## Screen 9
You should practice progressive relaxation exercise (all eight muscle groups, two times each muscle group) for 20-30 minutes two or three times each day.

Allow about thirty minutes of quiet time in a room where you will not be interrupted.  Identify days, times, and places to practice relaxation before leaving this session.

## Screen 2
This section of the program focuses on your interests and involvement in leisure and social activities. These activities should be (1) fun for you and (2) should not involve drug use. The goal is to increase social activities that are healthy alternatives to drug use.

## Screen 3
Because of your drug use, you may never have developed any regular, non-drug using activities. Alternatively, you may have stopped doing many of the non-drug activities you used to enjoy once you began to use drugs regularly.

Perhaps you used to play sports, exercise, go on hikes, go out to the movies, visit relatives, and so forth. But as your drug use increased, it gradually replaced regular fun, non-drug-related activities.

## Screen 4
Social and leisure activities are an important part of life. They provide:

- a source of enjoyment that you can look forward to after a stressful day at work or taking care of the kids
- a way to decrease boredom when you have free time
- a way to feel physically healthy
- a method for finding a skill that makes you feel good about yourself
- a chance to be with people you would like to have as friends

## Screen 5
Social and leisure activities can play a very important part in becoming and staying drug free. When you stop using drugs, you have to do something else during the times when you were using. If the things you do during that time are not satisfying, or you merely sit around feeling lonely or bored, you are more likely to relapse to drug use.

## Screen 6
Developing regular, satisfying social and leisure activities can be difficult. Sometimes it is hard to:

- find someone who is not a drug user to do things with 
- think of things you would like to do that you can afford
- fit activities into your schedule because of work or family duties
- start something new

## Screen 7
Positive social activities are important in starting a healthy lifestyle. Since it can be difficult to begin a new routine, this session will give you skills and ideas to identify your interests and increase safe, non-drug using activities.

## Screen 8
The first step in social counseling is to make a list of enjoyable activities that you may want to try. Think about these questions:

- What activities do you enjoy now?
- What activities have you enjoyed in the past?
- What activities have you always wanted to do, but have never done?

## Screen 9
Once you figure out possible activities, you should sort out activities by:

- your amount of interest
- cost
- whether other people need to be involved (such as games or some sports)
- how much time it takes
- how likely it is that you will do this activity

You should also think about whether the activity is physical or inactive. You should have a mix of active and relaxing activities.

## Screen 10
An important goal for most people addicted to drugs is to increase time spent with non-drug-using persons and end contact with drug abusers. As a result, the next step is to create a list of persons who might participate in activities with you.

## Screen 11
This can be very difficult, because you may believe that you don’t know anyone who is not a drug user; however, this is rarely true. Think about your extended family and old friends, and you can usually name at least one safe person to contact.

## Screen 12
Finding safe people is a high priority. Creating a network of non-using friends or family members can play an important role in helping you become and remain abstinent from drugs.

## Screen 13
You should decide on goals for getting involved in a specific activity. Goals may include taking the necessary steps toward starting this activity or increasing the time you spend with non-drug-using people.

For example, you could start by simply calling a "safe" non-drug-using friend on the phone. You could then ask this person to join you for a brief activity, like meeting for a cup of coffee. Eventually, you could plan a more involved activity with them.

## Screen 14
You can look at listings of local activities, recreational services, educational classes, and other community resources or events. Also, you can ask a therapist or another staff member for information about events in the area.

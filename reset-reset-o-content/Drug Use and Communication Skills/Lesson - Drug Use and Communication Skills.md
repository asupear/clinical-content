# Lesson - Drug Use and Communication Skills

## Screen 1
Like many drug abusers, you may have a hard time talking about and describing your feelings.  You may simply feel numb inside.  Discussing your feelings and talking about issues with others brings you closer together.  If you do not talk about feelings, this actually shuts people out and keeps them at a distance.

## Screen 2
Does it sometimes seem that using drugs helps you express positive feelings?  Some people think that this is true, but actually, your true feelings may be hidden or changed by using drugs.

## Screen 3
Your feelings may not be genuine or honest if you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Learning how to express your true feelings without the use of drugs will help you build more trusting and intimate relationships.

## Screen 4
Using drugs reduces your ability to listen.  It is almost impossible to be a good listener if you are high on drugs.  It is hard to pay attention to the person talking, and this sends them the message that you donâ€™t care about what they are saying.

## Screen 5
Often, it is hard to remember what you have said if you are using drugs.  If a discussion occurs while you are under the influence of drugs, and the other person wants to talk more about what was being discussed at a later time, you may not be able to remember what has already been said.  Again, this can make the person feel like you do not care about them.

## Screen 6
Like other drug users, you may feel lonely and distanced from others.  This might lead you to use more drugs to cope with those feelings.  More drug use can push people further away.

## Screen 7
Expressing yourself without the use of drugs can allow you to listen closely to others.  This will show other people that you are interested in what they have to say.  Closer relationships will form, which will decrease any sense of loneliness you may be feeling.

## Screen 8
Drugs are often used to cope with negative feelings such as anger, stress and loneliness.  In reality, your drug use can cause arguments and push people away from you.

## Screen 9
Using other ways to cope with negative feelings (for example, learning to talk openly with others), will help you avoid turning to drugs in these situations.

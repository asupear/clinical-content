# Lesson - How to Express Oneself in an Assertive Manner

## Screen 1
Being assertive in a situation means deciding what you want to do and then acting on your decision without being pressured into acting a certain way by other people. Being assertive is the most effective way to interact with others. By being assertive, you will have the greatest chance of resolving conflict with another person and achieving your goals.

## Screen 2
In order to express yourself in an assertive manner when interacting with others, you should first take some time to consider the situation and decide what you wish to do.

## Screen 3
You should then directly and clearly express your opinion.

## Screen 4
When expressing yourself, be specific in telling the other person what you want. In this process, sometimes it may be necessary for you to restate your assertion. Being both persistent and consistent in making your point are key elements necessary to being effective in your assertion.

## Screen 5
Balance the negative with the positive. That is, if you have to be critical or say something that implies that you are blaming someone else, express something positive first.

## Screen 6
When expressing criticism, try to use "I" statements and talk about how a situation made you feel. For example, you could say to another person, "When you did X, I felt Y" instead of "X is a bad thing to do", or "X is the rudest thing that anyone could ever do!"

## Screen 7
Avoid expressing feelings with "you" statements (for example, "You make me feel awful"). These types of statements generally make other people feel defensive and make them want to strike back instead of appropriately resolve a conflict.

## Screen 8
Acknowledge the other personâ€™s rights and feelings in the situation instead of focusing only on your own rights and feelings. For example, "I know you are busy and it is hard for you to check in with me before you do X; however, if you did, it would make me feel less concerned and more valued."

## Screen 9
Be aware of your body language when interacting with others. That is, your body language and facial expressions should be consistent with your message.

## Screen 10
Your voice should be strong and definite. Your message should be communicated with authority but not hostility. Make good eye contact.

## Screen 11
Give others your complete attention when they speak and respond promptly to what they say. In doing this, you are showing them that you are striving for equality in your relationship with them.

## Screen 12
Remember that being willing to compromise when necessary is essential to effective interaction with others. Other people are more likely to listen to you and recognize that you are listening to them if you show that you are willing to work things out and come to an agreement that allows both of you to "win".

## Screen 13
Learning to be assertive requires active and conscious efforts to engage in this style of interacting with others. It may take some time for an assertive response to become your natural response if you have used other styles of interacting with others in the past. However, by regularly practicing these strategies for being assertive, an assertive response style will become more and more automatic for you and can help you successfully interact with others.

# Lesson - Coping with Anger

## Screen 1
You have already completed several sections of this program that review situations that may trigger feelings of anger. Awareness of possible triggers of anger and of angry feelings is necessary before one can make changes in their behavior.

## Screen 2
We are now going to focus on healthy ways of coping or managing these situations and feelings.

## Screen 3
Here are some suggested ways to deal with "anger" triggers. The first thing that one should do is calm down. The following are slogans or behaviors that you can say to yourself or follow that may help you with this process:

- Slow down.
- Take it easy.
- Take a deep breath.
- Cool it.
- Easy does it.
- Chill out.
- Deep-freeze.
- Relax.
- Count to 10.

## Screen 4
Think through the situation - Ask yourself the following questions: What's causing me to feel angry? Is this really directed to me personally? Is someone trying to provoke me? Are there positives in this situation? Review the specifics of the situation.

## Screen 5
Next, think about your options. Brainstorm various options and then problem solve which option seems most helpful. Consider: What can I do, and what is in my best interest in this situation? Angry feelings should be a signal to start problem-solving.

## Screen 6
When focusing on solutions, consider using relaxation or other coping skills to reduce tension and anger. Consider using effective communication skills like assertiveness and being willing to compromise with another person to resolve a conflict.

## Screen 7
After selecting your course of action, reflect on the situation. If you succeed in resolving the problem, congratulate yourself. If you find that you have not effectively resolved the conflict, consider another assertive response.

## Screen 8
And remember that it is important not to dwell on a situation that makes you angry which is not easily resolved. Stop thinking about it - let it go. Don't let it interfere with your life. Dwelling on such a situation may make you feel more upset or frustrated.

A trigger can be an individual, event, or situation, or any combination of these things. These triggers can be very subtle or very strong. Triggers do not make people use drugs, they just make it very likely that a person will want to. Thoughts and feelings are a product of the trigger. These are the internal reactions to the trigger and can be pleasant or unpleasant. They may be thoughts that your friends won't like you if you don't use, a desire to get even with someone, etc. These thoughts and feelings result in the desire to do something.

### Answers
+ Negative
+ __Positive__
+ Delayed
+ Harmful

### Explanation
**Positive Consequences** of using are the rewarding effects that immediately follow using. They are usually considered to be pleasant. Users have learned to use drugs to forget, to become energized, to get rid of depressed feelings, to reduce pain, to feel good, etc. The user learns to expect these positive consequences from using drugs. Because drug use results in a lot of these short-term-positive consequences, it is a hard habit to break.

### Answers
+ __Negative__
+ Positive
+ Immediate
+ Rewarding

### Explanation
**Negative Consequences** of using are the effects of drugs that reduce the quality of a person's life. They are what brought you into treatment, and they don't usually occur until some-time after the using episode, that is, they are delayed, long-term consequences. Because the negative consequences (physical illness, family problems, legal problems, work problems, friend problems, financial problems, emotional problems) happen too far in the future, the user doesn't learn how much drugs use really hurts them.

People who have HIV have many different feelings when they learn that they are infected including anger, surprise, confusion, hopelessness, sadness, isolation, and fear.  There are lots of things that you can do to help deal with your feelings about having HIV.  It is also important to know that you are not alone; there are other people who have HIV and there are people who can help you cope with the disease.

## Screen 2
You may be worried about telling other people about your HIV because of fear of how they will react.  Unfortunately, because there is still a great deal of ignorance about HIV, some people can be cruel and unpredictable when they learn that you are infected.  Who and when to tell is a decision that you need to make for yourself.  It can be very helpful to reach out to trusted friends and loved ones who can be supportive.

## Screen 4
It will also be important to take precautions to make sure that you are not putting other people around you at risk for getting infected with HIV.  Practice safer sex with any sex partner.  If you use drugs, try to stop.  There are programs that can help you to stop using drugs.  If you continue to use drugs, do not share needles, straws, pipes, or works with anyone else.  You cannot give someone HIV by hugging, sharing eating utensils, coughing, or kissing.

Try to find a supportive and understanding person or group who will listen.

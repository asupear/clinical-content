# Lesson - Relationship Counseling Part 1

## Screen 1
Improving Communication with Your Partner: Part 1

In this section of the program, you will be presented with a list of communication skills that you may find helpful. They are designed to improve interactions with your partner.

## Screen 2
*Be polite to your partner*. When talking with your partner, use the same courteous words and tone you would with a stranger or a co-worker. This shows that you respect your partner.

## Screen 3
*Express positive feelings*. Try to let your partner know what you like about what they have done or how they have been acting. Don’t forget to focus at least as much time on the things that are going well in your relationship with them as you do on the negative things.

## Screen 4
*Do something nice for your partner*. This includes doing nice things without being asked or without a special reason like a birthday. Do something that your partner would like or find special. Do this without asking for or expecting something in return.

## Screen 5
*Make sure an issue is truly important before you complain*. Ask yourself whether or not something is worth complaining about. Don’t get into the habit of always complaining about something. Express complaints only about things that matter.

## Screen 6
*Choose a "good" time to bring up a complaint*. You should try to pick a time to discuss a problem that will provide a good setting for a positive discussion. For example, make sure you will have enough time to talk about the complaint. Do not discuss a problem when you are really angry. Also, don’t discuss a problem when your partner is angry.

## Screen 7
*Have a goal in mind when you bring up a complaint*. Give some thought to the problem before bringing it up with your partner. What would you like to get out of this discussion? What changes are you hoping for? Why do you want those changes? Are those changes reasonable or achievable?

## Screen 8
*Be specific with your complaint*. Focus on only one thing at a time. Try to have a very specific example of what you are upset about so that you can help your partner understand exactly what the issue is.

You should be able to tell your partner specifically what you would like him or her to do differently. Don’t bring up other problems. Stay focused on one specific problem at a time.

## Screen 9
*Ask for changes in a positive way*. Tell your partner in the most positive way possible what is bothering you and what you would like changed. Avoid criticisms, put downs, and name-calling. Asking for changes in a negative way can make the situation worse.

Don’t make assumptions about your partner’s motives. You should not assume that your partner is trying to intentionally annoy or upset you.

## Screen 10
*Prepare to compromise*. Be prepared to discuss the issue and come up with a solution that works for both of you. Don’t use ultimatums, such as "I want you to do this or else..." Be open to your partner’s ideas and needs.

# Lesson - Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)

## Screen 1
STI stands for sexually transmitted infection. STIs are also known as sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs. In addition to HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), there are many other infections that can be transmitted during sexual activity.

## Screen 2
STIs can be spread during vaginal sex (when the penis enters the vagina), anal sex (when the penis enters the anus or butt), and oral sex (when the mouth is placed on the vagina, penis, or anus). Some STIs can also be spread through skin to skin contact even without penetration.

## Screen 3
Most STIs can be treated and some can be cured. STIs that are not treated can cause serious health problems like sterility (meaning a person is not able to have children), blindness, cancer and even death.

## Screen 4
The best way to prevent getting an STI is to avoid sexual activity. If you are sexually active with a partner, condoms and other latex barriers can help reduce the risk of infection with an STI.

## Screen 5
Many people who have STIs do not have any signs or symptoms, but can still pass them on to other people. You may not be able to tell just by looking at a partner’s genitals whether or not he or she has an STI.

## Screen 6
People who have an STI that causes sores or irritation of the genitals or mouth may be at increased risk for HIV because it will be easier for infected fluid (blood, vaginal fluid or semen) to get into the bloodstream through the irritated skin. Now we’ll discuss several of the more common STIs in more detail.

## Screen 7
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the term used for a group of viruses that cause genital warts and can cause cancer of the cervix, anus and penis. HPV is spread through sexual activity with an infected person. HPV can also be passed from mother to baby during birth, but this is rare.

## Screen 8
Most people who have HPV do not even know it. For women, HPV is often diagnosed through a pap smear, which detects abnormal cells on the cervix. Some people develop warts on the vulva, cervix, in or around the vagina or anus, and on the penis, scrotum, groin or thigh. There is no cure for HPV, but there are treatments for the warts it may cause.

## Screen 9
Condoms can reduce the risk of HPV infection, but infection can occur even with the use of condoms, since sometimes the infected area is outside of the area covered by the condom.

## Screen 10
Gonorrhea is an STI caused by bacteria that can infect the cervix, uterus and fallopian tubes in women, and the urethra in both men and women. It can also infect the mouth, throat and anus. Gonorrhea can be spread through oral, anal and vaginal sex with an infected person.

## Screen 11
Symptoms of gonorrhea can include painful urination and/or bowel movements, painful or swollen testicles in men, and a yellow discharge. It can take 2-30 days for symptoms to show up, and many women never have early symptoms. If untreated, gonorrhea can also cause pain in the lower abdomen, fever, vomiting and, in women, it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) which can cause sterility.

## Screen 12
Gonorrhea can be treated and cured with antibiotics. Using condoms or latex barriers for oral, anal and vaginal sex can greatly reduce the risk of transmission.

## Screen 13
Chlamydia is an STI caused by bacteria that can infect the cervix in women, the urethra in both men and women, and the anus and throat. Chlamydia can be spread through oral, vaginal, and anal sex, as well as from mother to baby during birth.

## Screen 14
Many people (at least half) with chlamydia do not have any symptoms at all at first. Gradually an odorless discharge and pain with urination can develop, and in women chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

## Screen 15
Chlamydia can be treated and cured with antibiotics. Using condoms or latex barriers for oral, anal, and vaginal sex can greatly reduce the risk of transmission.

## Screen 16
Herpes is caused by two types of viruses, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2). HSV 1 can infect the mouth and lips, and both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can infect areas on and around the genitals and rectum.

## Screen 17
HSV-1 is spread through saliva and through oral-genital contact. HSV-2 is spread primarily through vaginal and anal sex. Herpes can also be spread from mother to baby during birth.

## Screen 18
Many people with HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 do not have any signs or symptoms. When they do, they have blisters that break and can be very sore on the mouth, lips, genitals or rectum. These are known as outbreaks. Outbreaks usually become less severe and less frequent over time.

## Screen 19
There is no cure for herpes, but there are medications that can help shorten outbreaks and reduce their frequency. Condoms can reduce the risk of herpes, but infection can occur even with the use of condoms, since sometimes the infected area is outside of the area covered by the condom. Herpes can be spread even when there is no visible outbreak.

## Screen 20
Syphilis is an STI caused by bacteria. Syphilis can infect primarily the genitals and rectum, and occasionally the mouth. Syphilis is spread through oral, vaginal or anal sex. Syphilis can also be spread from mother to baby during birth. Syphilis can infect areas on and around the genitals, anus and rectum.

## Screen 21
There are several stages of syphilis. In the first stage, a painless sore develops called a chancre. If untreated, the disease's second stage is the development of a rash on the entire body, or on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. In addition, there might be fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, muscle aches and tiredness.

## Screen 22
In the third stage of syphilis, it begins to damage internal organs and can lead to blindness, brain damage and possibly death.

## Screen 23
Syphilis can be treated and cured with antibiotics. Condoms can reduce the risk of syphilis, but infection can occur even with the use of condoms, since sometimes the infected area is outside of the area covered by the condom.

## Screen 24
There are other common STIs such as vaginitis, trichomoniasis, pubic lice, crabs and scabies. Most STIs can be tested for by a health care provider. If you have an STI, the sooner you know it, the sooner you can start treatment and help prevent spreading it to others.

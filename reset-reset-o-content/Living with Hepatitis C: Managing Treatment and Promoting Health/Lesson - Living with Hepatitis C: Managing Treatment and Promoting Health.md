# Lesson - Living with Hepatitis C: Managing Treatment and Promoting Health

## Screen 1
Once you know that you have hepatitis C, there are things that you can do to try to stay as healthy as possible. Even though many people have no symptoms of hepatitis C for many years, over time the virus can silently cause permanent damage to your liver. You can help prevent this damage and help minimize the symptoms of hepatitis by following your health care provider’s treatment plan and advice for healthy daily routines.

## Screen 2
The first step in managing hepatitis C is to see a health care provider who has experience treating the virus. This could be a Gastroenterologist, Hepatologist, or an Infectious Disease Specialist. There are medications available for hepatitis C that may be able to rid the body of the virus. Your health care provider can assess the health of your liver, and recommend which treatment options might be best for you. It is important to let your health care provider know about any medications, herbs, vitamins, alcohol and other drugs that you are using.

## Screen 3
In addition to medications, there are other things you can do to feel as healthy as possible and minimize the effects of hepatitis on your liver. These include a healthy diet, exercise, getting enough sleep, reducing stress and avoiding alcohol and other harmful drugs.

## Screen 4
Eating a healthy diet can give you energy to get through the day and can help your liver stay healthy. Some of the medications that are used to treat hepatitis C can cause a loss of appetite, but it is important to try to eat small, healthy meals throughout the day. Limit foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar (like fast food, processed cold cuts and cheeses), as they can be hard on the liver. It is important to talk to your health care provider before using any herbal or vitamin supplements to find out how they might affect your liver.

## Screen 5
Try to find activities that you enjoy and that help relieve your stress. Exercise can help increase your energy level and help you to feel better about yourself. It doesn’t have to be strenuous to feel the benefits; even going for a walk every day can help. Some people find therapies such as yoga and meditation to be helpful in managing stress as well as the symptoms of hepatitis C.

## Screen 6
Try to get enough sleep each night so that you feel rested. Sometimes the medications for hepatitis C can cause insomnia, or difficulty sleeping. If you are experiencing this, talk to your health care provider about possible solutions.

## Screen 7
The use of even a small amount of alcohol can make the liver damage from hepatitis C much worse. If you use alcohol, there are programs that can help you stop. For information about how to stop using alcohol, contact the national hotline for information and referrals to treatment sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The number is: **1-800-662-HELP (4357)**.

## Screen 8
If you use other drugs, you may be putting yourself at increased risk for liver damage as well as other viruses such as hepatitis B or HIV. The stress of using other drugs on your mind and body can make hepatitis C progress more quickly. In addition, if you are sharing drug equipment, you may be putting other people at risk for getting hepatitis C. The best thing you could do for your health is to stop using drugs. If you continue to use drugs, do not share any drug equipment that might have blood on it.

## Screen 9
You may want to consider getting vaccinated for hepatitis A and B, if you have not already. The vaccine can prevent you from getting infected with another virus that can harm the liver. You may also want to consider getting tested for HIV. Having hepatitis C is stressful to your body and can be further complicated by co-infection with another harmful virus.

## Screen 10
You can take control over your own health by implementing healthy daily habits, learning everything that you can about hepatitis C, finding support from others, and seeing your health care provider regularly. You can live a long, healthy life with hepatitis C, but it requires you to take good care of yourself.

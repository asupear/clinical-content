# Lesson - Detoxification Training

## Screen 1
This section of the program focuses on helping you prepare for the detoxification phase of your treatment program. Many clients fear this period based on their own past experience of trying to detoxify themselves.  Sometimes they have heard bad stories from others.  This section of the program is designed to address those fears.  You will also learn ways to cope effectively with your own detoxification.

## Screen 2
During your detoxification, the medication you are receiving will be slowly reduced over many weeks.  The slow detoxification is designed to make the withdrawal symptoms and the possibility of discomfort as minimal as possible.  You may also receive additional medication to either help with opiate withdrawal symptoms or sleeping problems.

## Screen 3
Opiate withdrawal symptoms have been described as flu-like.  Like the flu, withdrawal symptoms are not life threatening and not to be feared.  Withdrawal symptoms are not fatal.

## Screen 4
Listed below are potential symptoms that you may feel during the detoxification.  There are also suggestions for how to respond to these symptoms.  All of the responses consist of living a healthy lifestyle (eating well and exercising), common sense (appropriate dress), and use of over-the-counter remedies only.

## Screen 5
You should never use opioids during detoxification. The reason for this should be obvious, but you are at the greatest risk of relapse during this phase of treatment.  Even minimal use can result in a full-blown relapse.

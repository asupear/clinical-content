# Lesson - Identifying and Managing Triggers for Risky Sexual Activity

## Screen 1
Think about the last time you did something risky. It could be something like driving too fast, riding your bike or skateboard without a helmet, unprotected sex, or anything else that could have health risks.

- What was going on at the time?
- Where were you?
- Who were you with?
- How were you feeling?
- Were you drinking or getting high?

## Screen 2
All of these things that you just thought about are called triggers. Triggers are things that are going on around you that can influence the choices that you make. They can include people, places, feelings, and substances.

## Screen 3
Recognizing triggers and how they influence you is an important part of learning how to make safer choices about sex. Let’s look at different kinds of triggers and how they may influence the choices we make about sex.

## Screen 4
People who influence us can be triggers for risky behavior. Think about the people in your life who influence what you do. Now think again about the last time you did the risky behavior that you thought about a minute ago. Why might it have been difficult to make a different choice in that situation?

## Screen 5
It can be very difficult to talk with a partner about safer sex, particularly if that person is very influential to you. Some reasons it might be difficult to bring up safer sex include the following:

- you are very attracted to that person
- you do not want to lose the relationship
- you want the person to like you
- you are afraid of the person

## Screen 6
Places can also be triggers. Think about where you were and what was going on around you the last time you did something risky. Was it a place where you had taken this risk before? A place that makes you feel really good about yourself, or really bad? A place where there were other people taking this risk?

## Screen 7
Feelings and moods can also lead us to risky sex. You may be feeling happy; sad; lonely; desperate; confused; depressed; ashamed; carefree; and the way you are feeling can affect the choices that you make in sexual situations.

## Screen 8
Substances like drugs and alcohol can also lead us to have unprotected sex. This can happen because drugs and alcohol lower inhibitions and affect our ability to make decisions. Having a strong need to get drugs or alcohol can also influence decisions about sexual behavior.

## Screen 9
Once you identify your own triggers, you can work on managing them so that you can take charge and reduce the chance that you’ll end up taking risks, including having risky sex. By thinking through potential triggers ahead of time, you are better able to reduce your risk when you are in the situation.

## Screen 10
Let’s imagine that you are planning to go to a party and you know that there may be people there who are drinking and/or having sex. The potential triggers in this situation could be:

- the place where the party is held (maybe it is a place you have had sex before, or maybe other people at the party will be having sex)
- the people who are there (maybe friends who have been pressuring you to have sex, or maybe there is someone in particular there that you are attracted to)
- the alcohol
- how you feel while at the party (you may feel anxious about talking to people you don’t know, or you may feel carefree)

## Screen 11
What can you do to reduce the influence of these triggers in this situation and reduce your risk of having unprotected sex?

- You could choose not to go to the party
- You could go to the party and choose not to drink any alcohol
- You could make sure you have condoms with you before you go
- You could go with a friend that respects your choices and does not pressure you to do things you may not want to do

## Screen 12
Triggers do not cause you to take risks, but they can make it harder to make healthy decisions. You can take charge of how much they influence you. By being aware of what your own triggers are, you can prepare yourself to handle them before you are in a situation that could lead to risky sexual activity.

# Lesson - Attentive Listening

## Screen 1
Listening is an important communication skill. It helps us build strong, trusting relationships with others. The goals of attentive listening include:

- letting the speaker know you are listening
- letting the speaker feel you are listening
- letting the speaker know that you understand correctly
- building trust with the speaker
- gathering information

## Screen 2
Listening is an active skill that requires practice. Attentive listening involves both verbal and non-verbal behavior.

## Screen 3
An effective verbal behavior to show that you are listening to another person includes confirming the other person’s feelings. For example, if someone has expressed anger and frustration after losing his/her wallet, you might validate these feelings by saying something like, "You must feel really upset. I would feel frustrated too if I were you."

## Screen 4
Effective verbal behavior may also include rewording what had been said. That is, repeating back to the speaker what you understood him or her to say, using your own language. This is part of the attentive listening process.

## Screen 5
A good listener asks questions but does not interrupt the speaker. The speaker should be allowed to finish his/her train of thought before you speak. You should avoid changing the subject right after the person has finished talking. This might send the message that you didn’t listen to what they were saying or did not think it was important.

## Screen 6
Active listening is also a non-verbal behavior that helps you focus on the person who is speaking. It includes paying attention to both the feelings that a person expresses and their non-verbal behavior. You may choose to respond to the content of what is said or to the emotions expressed by the speaker.

Active listening means giving your full attention to the person who is talking. If you are not listening carefully, you may ask questions about something the person has already discussed. This can send the message that you are ignoring them, or that they are not important to you.

## Screen 7
Body language is another example of non-verbal behavior. Your body language shows the speaker whether or not you are paying attention. Look the speaker in the eyes and face the speaker when listening. An open posture, without arms folded, is a welcoming position. When listening, do not squirm or show that you are impatient, distracted or bored.

## Screen 8
Being an attentive listener lets others know you are interested in, and want to understand what they have to say. Attentive listening also encourages others to talk further about themselves, which allows you to learn things about the other person that you might otherwise miss.

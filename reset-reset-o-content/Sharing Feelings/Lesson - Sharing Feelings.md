# Lesson - Sharing Feelings

## Screen 1
Everybody has feelings that can range from sadness, to anger, to happiness, to fear. Some people may have certain feelings more often than others, but it is safe to say that we all have a wide variety of feelings. There are several benefits to sharing feelings with other people.

## Screen 2
Learning how to talk about feelings may help to create more of a connection with others. Sharing feelings can strengthen relationships with people you want to know better. It can also be a way of moving conversations to more meaningful topics.

## Screen 3
Building more of a relationship with others can be very important for people who are shy and timid. Often, shy individuals can be seen as distant or snobby. This false belief will likely affect the way others perceive a shy individual, unless that person can share more information about who they are and how they are feeling.

## Screen 4
A good way to get to know someone better is to express your feelings about an event or situation. Also, you can ask questions to help others share their feelings with you. For example, "how do you like living in this neighborhood? How did it feel to be the oldest brother/sister in your family? Did you enjoy the fair this year?"

## Screen 5
Sharing your feelings with another person will help him/her feel closer to you. You can also find that you have things in common with that person which may enhance your relationship with them. This may include shared hobbies or activities that you can do together.

## Screen 6
Expressing your own feelings sends the message that you are open to sharing on a more personal level. Sharing feelings increases the connection between two people. It also builds trust.

## Screen 7
One of the benefits of sharing feelings with another person is that both you and the other person can feel supported and know that you aren't alone in feeling something. If someone is sad about an event and shares this with you, you may learn that you are not the only person who feels this way. This may take away some of the pain or uneasiness for both of you.

## Screen 8
Sharing a range of feelings is also important. Some individuals have difficulty expressing either positive or negative feelings. For instance, some people may only like to open up to others when they are happy or successful. Others may only like to talk about things that they are sad or angry about. If you don't share a range of feelings with others, it prevents other individuals from knowing you as a total person.

## Screen 9
It is important to know who to share feelings with, and how much to share with that person. Talking about very personal feelings to a person the first time you meet them may be unwise, since you have not built a trusting relationship with them yet. It could also make another person feel uncomfortable hearing about such personal information too soon.

## Screen 10
Remember that feelings are something we all have in common. It is useful to talk about your feelings, because this can actually build closer, healthier relationships with others. Also, if you do not share feelings with people in your life this can create problems such as arguments, lack of trust, and understanding.

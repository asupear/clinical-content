# Lesson - Introduction to Assertiveness

## Screen 1
"Assertiveness" is probably a word that you’ve heard many times, but what does it really mean to be "assertive"?

## Screen 2
Assertiveness means exercising your right to decide what you would like to do when you interact with other people without denying the rights of others. Being assertive in a situation means deciding what you want to do and then acting on your decision without being pressured into acting a certain way by other people.

## Screen 3
When you interact with others, you have the right to inform them of your opinion and about how you feel. You also have the right to ask other people to change their behavior if it is affecting you. Additionally, you have the right to accept or reject requests that other people may make of you.

## Screen 4
Being assertive does not mean, however, being disrespectful to others. When you interact with other people, it is important to recognize and respect their rights as well as your own.

## Screen 6
Being assertive is just one of several ways that you can interact with other people. Other interpersonal styles or ways of interacting with others include being passive, aggressive, or passive-aggressive.

## Screen 7
A person who is passive tends to deny their own rights while interacting with others. A passive person may avoid expressing thoughts or feelings in situations where they may have a different opinion than another person. Passive people may then feel hurt, angry or anxious when they don’t express their opinion. By letting others make decisions without their input, passive people tend to fail to achieve their desired goals.

## Screen 9
A person who is aggressive tends to exert their rights without respecting the rights of others. An aggressive person may accomplish short-term goals; however, they generally hurt others in the process. Aggressive people may criticize others and minimize their worth and often create hatred and resentment in others. Aggressive people generally fail to achieve their long-term goals, because people generally do not want to interact with them. Some people may even try to “get even” or retaliate against them in response to their aggressive behavior.

## Screen 11
A person who is passive-aggressive tends to engage in indirect behavior. This means that people may hint at what they want; however, they never directly state their opinions or requests. A passive-aggressive person may act out what they want to say without ever saying it. For example, they may give another person “the silent treatment” or may slam doors to express their frustration with others. Passive-aggressive people may or may not get what they want. Because others may not clearly understand the behavior or intentions of a passive-aggressive person, they may become confused or angry, causing the passive-aggressive person to become frustrated or feel like a victim.

## Screen 12

## Screen 13
Unlike passive, aggressive or passive-aggressive people, a person who is assertive tends to make decisions about what they want, plan how they will appropriately achieve their goals and express their feelings honestly while respecting the rights of others. Usually an assertive person will express their opinion directly; however, an assertive person may adapt their behavior to best respond to a situation.

## Screen 14
Being assertive is the most effective way to interact with others. By honestly expressing yourself, you will have the greatest chance of resolving conflict with another person and achieving your goals.

A person who is aggressive tends to exert their rights without respecting the rights of others. An aggressive person may accomplish short-term goals; however, they generally hurt others in the process. Aggressive people may criticize others and minimize their worth and often create hatred and resentment in others. Aggressive people generally fail to achieve their long-term goals, because people generally do not want to interact with them. Some people may even try to "get even" or retaliate against them in response to their aggressive behavior.

+ directly criticize and minimize the worth of others
+ respect the thoughts and feelings of others

### Explanation
A person who is passive-aggressive tends to engage in indirect behavior. This means that people may hint at what they want; however, they never directly state their opinions or requests. A passive-aggressive person may act out what they want to say without ever saying it. For example, they may give another person "the silent treatment" or may slam doors to express their frustration with others. Passive-aggressive people may or may not get what they want. Because others may not clearly understand the behavior or intentions of a passive-aggressive person, they may become confused or angry, causing the passive-aggressive person to become frustrated or feel like a victim.

A person who is passive tends to deny their own rights while interacting with others. A passive person may avoid expressing thoughts or feelings in situations where they may have a different opinion than another person. Passive people may then feel hurt, angry or anxious when they don't express their opinion. By letting others make decisions without their input, passive people tend to fail to achieve their desired goals.

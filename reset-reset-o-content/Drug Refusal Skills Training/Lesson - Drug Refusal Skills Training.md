# Lesson - Drug Refusal Skills Training

## Screen 1
As many as one-third of drug abusers relapse from peer pressure to use drugs after successfully becoming drug-free. Most drug abusers who are trying to quit continue to have some contact either planned or unexpected with people who are still using drugs.

## Screen 2
Turning down drugs or opportunities to go places where drugs are available may be much more difficult than you think. The ability to refuse drugs when they are offered to you is a special case of assertiveness or strongly stating your preferences.

## Screen 3
Drug refusal training can be very important in helping you achieve a meaningful period of abstinence and help you maintain that abstinence. This section of the program will teach you how to refuse to take drugs, and how to refuse to go to places where drugs are available.

## Screen 4
The ability to effectively refuse to take drugs, or to go places where drugs are available will help you feel in control when faced with tempting situations. You can learn this skill even if you have said “yes” automatically when offered drugs in the past.

## Screen 5
Drug dependent individuals usually underestimate the difficulties they will face when they try to refuse or avoid drugs. You may feel that it will be easy for you to say no, or that others will not ask you if they know you are trying to quit. However, other people have found that if they don’t plan for these situations, good intentions don’t always lead to effective drug refusal. Other people with a history of drug dependence have found practicing specific refusal skills helps them refuse drugs when they face high-risk situations.

## Screen 6
An important part of this process is for you to be creative in anticipating many of the high-risk situations that you’ll face in the following months. We’ve developed some examples that we feel are typical of what many drug abusers face, but each person has a unique set of circumstances.  This training will benefit you most if you include high-risk situations from your own life so that you can plan for them.

## Screen 7
Remember that those people who offer you drugs are not thinking of your best interests. They may be your friends, but once you’ve decided to quit, it’s important for you to consider anyone who asks you to use drugs or to go party as a pusher. They must be discouraged-politely, if possible, but **firmly**.

## Screen 8
Saying "no" is the first and most important part of your refusal response. There are different ways of saying no, which are appropriate in different situations. Everybody says no differently. It’s important to feel comfortable, which means that you have to develop your own style. When developing your own style, remember the following important goals:
- Your primary goal is to refuse or turn down drugs.
- Your secondary goal might be to reinforce your commitment to not use.
- A third goal might be to feel good about yourself for refusing to take drugs.

## Screen 9
When creating your own refusal style, specific parts of your response will increase the chance that it will be effective.

- "No" should be the first thing you say.
- Examples of saying "No" include "No, thank you" or  "No, I am not using anymore; it is causing me too many problems".
- Tell the person offering you drugs, "Do not ask me now or in the future if I want to do drugs."  "I don’t do drugs any more."
- Saying things like "maybe later," "I have to get home," or "I’m on medication" just make it likely that they will offer you drugs in the future.

## Screen 10

## Screen 11
Kate did a good job saying the right things, but her body language was not convincing at all, and drug abusers are generally very good at reading between the lines.  Body language is important. 

- Make continuous eye contact; look directly at the person when you answer.
- Your expression and tone should clearly show that you are serious.  For example, smiling when you respond may suggest that you are not serious.

## Screen 12
Watch the scene again and notice Kate’s body language.

## Screen 13
It’s rare that users will give up so easily when they’re trying to convince you to use. If you feel you’re not getting your message across, offer an alternative if you want to do something else with that person.

- Make sure that it’s incompatible with drug use (for example, taking your children for a walk or to the park, going to work out).
- Change the subject to a new topic of conversation.

## Screen 14

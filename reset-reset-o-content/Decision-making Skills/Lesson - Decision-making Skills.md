# Lesson - Decision-making Skills

## Screen 1
It can be hard sometimes to make good decisions about sex, drugs and alcohol use when there are so many different pressures on you from family and friends. It is important to remember that you always have choices, no matter what the situation is, and no matter what you have chosen before. Those choices that you can make also always have consequences; good, bad or a little of both.

## Screen 2
There are lots of different ways that people make decisions. Some people are impulsive and take the first choice they are presented with; others avoid making a decision or let someone else decide; some go with their gut feeling; some struggle with the choices for a long time; and others weigh the facts and feelings to reach a decision. Decision making takes practice.

## Screen 3
When making decisions, it is important to think about what is important to you, what goals you have for yourself in the future, and what you have decided are your personal limits regarding sex and drug use. Let’s look at a strategy that can help you make decisions by weighing the pros and cons of different choices and then make the decision that is best for you.

## Screen 4
The SODAS approach to making decisions has five different steps or components.

S: Situation
O: Options
D: Disadvantages
A: Advantages
S: Solution

We will discuss each of these steps in the SODAS approach one at a time.

## Screen 5
S: Situation

The first step is to identify the situation in which you need to make a decision.

## Screen 6
O: Options

The second step is to identify the different options that you have or choices that you could make.

## Screen 7
D: Disadvantages

Next think about all of the possible disadvantages or cons of each option or choice.

## Screen 8
A: Advantages

Then think about the possible advantages or pros of each option or choice.

## Screen 9

Lastly, decide on which option or choice you would like to make as the solution to the situation.

## Screen 10
Let’s watch a video that shows these steps in action. James is at a party with his friends. He has set a personal limit for himself that he will not have sex with a girl until they have dated for awhile, and then only with a condom.

## Screen 13
Remember to think about what is important to you when making decisions. Also, sometimes you may need more time to think about the choice you want to make. In many situations, it is possible to say “I need some time to think about it. Can I get back to you?” You may make a better decision if you give yourself a little more time to work through the steps we have discussed, rather than making a snap decision in the moment.

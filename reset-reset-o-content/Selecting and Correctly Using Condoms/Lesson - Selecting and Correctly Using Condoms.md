# Lesson - Selecting and Correctly Using Condoms

## Screen 1
There are lots of different choices of types of condoms.  You can find condoms made out of different materials, with different textures, colors, shapes, and even flavors.  But not all condoms work equally well for preventing HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

## Screen 2
The best, most effective type of condom for protection against HIV and STIs is a condom made out of latex.  While it is important to note that no method except for abstaining from sex is 100% effective in preventing infection with HIV and STIs, using latex condoms correctly every time can greatly reduce the risk of infection.

## Screen 3
Condoms can also be made out of animal skin (sometimes called lambskin or natural skin), but these condoms may have tiny holes in them that you can’t see but that HIV can pass through.  Because of this, animal skin, lambskin, and natural skin condoms are not effective choices in reducing risk for HIV and other STIs.

## Screen 4
Some people are allergic to latex and may find that they experience skin irritation when using latex condoms.  There are condoms available that are made out of polyurethane, which is a type of plastic.  Polyurethane condoms have not been studied as extensively as latex condoms for the prevention of pregnancy and infections, but may offer some protection.

## Screen 5
There are also condoms that are designed to be used for fun but do not protect you against infections.  These are often called novelty condoms, and often have warnings on the package that say that they are not intended for use to prevent HIV or other diseases.  Remember to always choose a condom that says it is made of latex on the package.

## Screen 6
You may want to experiment with different brands of latex condoms until you find one that you are comfortable with.  There are lots of different choices, so if one brand or style does not feel good, try another.

## Screen 7
Lubricant can be used with condoms to make sex feel better and to help reduce the chance it will rip or tear.  Make sure that you choose a lubricant that is water-based rather than oil based.  Some examples of water-based lubricants that are safe to use with latex condoms include Aqualube®, Astroglide®, K-Y® jelly, I-D® and Wet®.

## Screen 8
Some examples or oil-based lubricants that are NOT safe to use with latex condoms include baby oil, cold creams, cooking oils, butter, massage oils, petroleum jelly (like Vaseline®), suntan oils and lotions, Bag Balm®, hand lotions, and vaginal yeast infection medications.  The oil in these products can cause latex to break more easily.

## Screen 9
It is also important to store condoms in a cool, dry place.  If condoms are exposed to heat, sunlight, or hot air for a long time, they are more likely to break.  It is not a good idea to keep condoms in your back pocket, your wallet, or glove compartment.

## Screen 10
It is important to use a condom correctly.  If used incorrectly, condoms may break and may not offer the most protection against infection.  At this time, we’ll go through the steps to using a condom correctly.

## Screen 12
Condoms should only be used once and never reused.  Never use two condoms at the same time, either two male condoms (double bagging) or a male and a female condom together, as this increases the chance that they will break or fall off during sex.  Also if you are switching from anal sex to vaginal or oral sex, put on a new condom to avoid infections.

## Screen 13
It’s a good idea to practice putting on a condom, on a penis or on a banana or other penis-shaped object, before you need to use one in a  sexual situation.  Keep a supply of condoms near your bed, in your backpack, or in another place where it will be easy to get them when you need them.

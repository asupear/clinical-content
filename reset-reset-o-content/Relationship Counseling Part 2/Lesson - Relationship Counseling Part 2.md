# Lesson - Relationship Counseling Part 2

## Screen 1
Communication Skills: Improving Communication with Your Partner: Part 2

This section of the program discusses ways to improve communication with your partner. You will be given a brief outline of some important issues and behaviors that may help you through conflicts with your partner.

## Screen 2
*Expect to have disagreements: they are only natural*. Even in the best of relationships, partners do not always agree. Disagreements are a normal part of relationships.

Since arguments can be a trigger for drug use, it is important to learn how to resolve problems with your partner. This can prevent small problems from leading to drug use or full-blown relapse.

## Screen 3
*Some disagreements may not be real disagreements--they might be miscommunications*. The way something is said or the way a person hears the message may result in a fight.

## Screen 4
*Miscommunications typically result from not expressing yourself clearly, specifically or completely*. Do not assume that your partner knows or understands what you are trying to express.

Use examples to explain a problem. Provide reasons for why you are complaining or making a negative statement. Use the communication skills that you learned in this program when talking to your partner.

## Screen 5
Miscommunication can happen when your partner has an unexpected response to the message you are trying to send. Sometimes your statements impact your partner in a way that you did not intend. He or she may appear upset and you may not know why.

## Screen 6
*Your intent should predict your partnerâ€™s response*. If your message gets a response that you did not intend, something probably went wrong with the communication process. For example, if you are calmly trying to bring up a small issue and your partner explodes at you, there was probably a miscommunication.

## Screen 7
*A problem may have occurred with your message*. You could have sent a message that you did not intend by:

a. Not saying what you really meant.

b. Leaving out information, or assuming your partner knows something when they do not.

c. Giving a non-verbal message that did not match the verbal message (e.g., using a sharp tone of voice because you were in a bad mood).

d. Having a hidden agenda. Unresolved issues may come up in discussions about problems whenever you are upset. You might make statements that are related to past problems. This can make the current situation harder to resolve.

## Screen 8
*The problem may also occur with the person receiving the message*. The person receiving the message may have reacted differently than expected for some of the same types of reasons. They may have not heard your entire message. They may have resentment from past conflicts. They may seem to be avoiding eye contact or to not be listening, however their behavior may be related to a bad day at work, or other issues.

## Screen 9
You should use the information that you learned in this section of the program to understand disagreements that you may have with your partner and how to resolve them. Couples counseling is always an option. Please discuss this possibility with your therapist.

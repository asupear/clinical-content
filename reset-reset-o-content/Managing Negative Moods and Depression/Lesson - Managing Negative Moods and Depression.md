# Lesson - Managing Negative Moods and Depression

## Screen 1
Everyone experiences negative moods and depression at some point in their lives. This section of the program focuses on strategies you can use to effectively manage negative moods and depression when you experience them to keep them from negatively affecting your life, including your relationships, work performance, etc.

## Screen 2
Effectively managing negative moods and depression requires learning how to think about and act on these mood states when you experience them.

## Screen 3
In general, managing negative moods and depression involves the following sequence:

1. Become aware of your negative thoughts
2. Answer these negative thoughts with more realistic thoughts
3. Act on these new thoughts

These steps to follow when managing negative moods and depression are called the “three A’s”. We will discuss each of the three A’s in turn.

## Screen 4
Becoming aware of your negative thoughts is the first step in effectively managing negative moods and depression.

## Screen 5
When becoming aware of your negative thoughts, pay particularly close attention to "automatic negative thoughts". Automatic negative thoughts are negative thoughts that may pop into your head, almost instantly, and almost without your control.

## Screen 6
If you are in a negative mood or are depressed, automatic negative thoughts generally become stronger and stronger and often drown out more realistic thoughts. Automatic thoughts may also make your mood more negative or more depressed and, as a result, continue to increase the likelihood that you will believe them.

## Screen 7
The main characteristic of automatic thoughts is that they are generally wrong. Some examples of automatic negative thoughts that may increase one’s negative mood and depression include:

## Screen 8
*Personalizing*: Thinking that you are the central focus and that "Everyone’s eyes are upon me."

## Screen 28
It is important that you become aware of automatic negative thoughts. There are many ways you can do this, including:

1. Notice your mood changes
2. Pay attention to your feelings.
3. Pay attention to your body.
4. Notice when you avoid or disengage from your feelings
5. Notice if you start having difficulty focusing or making decisions in certain situations and consider thoughts you may have about making decisions in these settings
6. Identify activities that seem to require greater than usual effort to perform and consider your thoughts about those activities
7. You may even wish to write out your thoughts or set aside a specific time to identify and consider negative thoughts you may have.

## Screen 29
After you have become aware of your negative thoughts, you should then answer these negative thoughts with more realistic ones. Answering negative thoughts is the second "A" in the "three A’s" approach to managing negative moods and depression.

## Screen 30
In order to effectively answer negative thoughts, it is essential to recognize that there are several different interpretations of the same event and that some interpretations are more accurate than others. When answering your thoughts, consider a wide range of interpretations of some incident and not just the negative ones.

## Screen 31
When answering negative thoughts, ask yourself, "Are my assumptions correct?", "Am I using All or Nothing Thinking?", or "Am I placing unnecessary blame on myself?"

## Screen 32
Consider also, "Am I focusing on issues that are unimportant?", or "Am I assuming every situation is the same or am I instead taking into consideration differences across situations?"

Also think about "What are my goals, and is this type of thinking helping me reach my goals?"

Finally, consider if there are advantages to a particular way of thinking and consider if you would view the situation differently if you were not in a negative mood or depressed.

## Screen 33
After becoming aware of your negative thoughts and answering your negative thoughts with more realistic ones, you should then act on your new, more realistic thoughts. Acting on these more realistic thoughts represents the third "A" in the "three A’s" approach to managing negative moods and depression.

## Screen 34
By challenging self-defeating thoughts and acting on more positive and realistic thoughts, you can change your old way of thinking, be less likely to engage in automatic negative thinking, and strengthen new and more positive thought patterns.

# Lesson - Insomnia

## Screen 1
When people stop using drugs, they may have problems with insomnia or problems falling asleep, staying asleep, or not feeling rested after sleep. A regular sleep pattern is important for good physical and mental health. A lack of sleep is likely to get in the way of the lifestyle changes needed for abstaining from opioids.

## Screen 2
This section of the program suggests a treatment for sleeping problems that has been widely tested and shown to be effective. It helps people:

- Learn more about sleep.
- Keep a record of sleep patterns.
- Learn to use procedures that promote a regular sleep schedule.

## Screen 3
Like other aspects of treatment, this sleep program will involve learning and practice. The skills training teaches people how to:

- not do anything in bed except sleep
- use the feeling of sleepiness as a signal to go to bed
- stop doing things that are associated with staying awake instead of trying to go to sleep
- keep a regular sleep schedule

## Screen 4
Improving sleep habits will help a person sleep better and feel more rested. Developing these habits takes planning and practice. However, following through with the skills will improve a person’s sleeping schedule. The skills can be used for the rest of one’s life.

## Screen 5
Most likely, it will take several weeks to see any benefits from this sleep program. A person may continue to have sleep difficulties for the first few weeks. It is important not to be in too much of a hurry to sleep better. Like any other skill, learning good sleep habits takes time and practice to develop.

## Screen 6
These new habits may seem hard at first. They will become more comfortable with repeated practice. In the beginning, a person may wake up a number of times. However, teaching the body that bed is for sleeping, not for worrying, tossing and turning, reading, or other activities, is probably the most important part of this sleep program.

## Screen 7
An important part of building new and improved sleep habits is paying attention to sleep-related behaviors. It is important to watch these behaviors to figure out and build up actions that are related to falling asleep quickly. It is also important to notice and get rid of the behaviors related to staying awake.

## Screen 8
It is very important to keep a weekly sleep diary. The sleep diary is an inexpensive and easy way of keeping track of the behaviors related to sleep problems.

Please pick up a copy of the Weekly Sleep Diary at this time.

## Screen 9
The sleep diary is used to record estimates of how long it took for a person to fall asleep, how many hours a person slept, how difficult it was to fall asleep, and the quality of one’s sleep. It is important to find a place to keep this form so that one can remember to complete it *each morning* for a week. Throughout treatment, the diary should be reviewed to monitor sleep-related behaviors.

## Screen 10
The following guidelines are designed to help improve a person’s sleep patterns.

## Screen 11
**Rule 1**. Do not drink alcohol less than 2 hours before bedtime. Alcohol interferes with deep sleep.

## Screen 12
**Rule 2**. Do not consume caffeine after about 4 p.m. or within 6 hours of bedtime. Learn all the foods, beverages, and medications that contain caffeine.

Caffeine is a stimulant. If taken 6 hours before bedtime, caffeine may interfere with sleep onset. It will be more difficult to get to sleep after consuming caffeine.

## Screen 13
**Rule 3**. Do not smoke within several hours before bedtime.

Nicotine is a stimulant. If it is used before bedtime, nicotine may interfere with falling asleep.

## Screen 14
**Rule 4**. Exercise regularly. The best time to exercise is in the afternoon. Avoid lengthy workouts after 6 p.m.

Exercise sets off the body’s "fight-or-flight response" that makes someone feel wide-awake and ready for danger. This response interferes with a person’s ability to relax and sleep.

## Screen 15
**Rule 5**. Make the sleep environment the best for sleeping. Make sure there is a comfortable temperature and minimum levels of sound, light, and noise.

It is more difficult for a person to sleep when they are exposed to extreme levels of cold, heat, or sound.

## Screen 16
**Rule 6**. If a person is used to it, have a light carbohydrate snack before bedtime (like crackers, graham crackers, milk, or cheese). Do not eat chocolate or large amounts of sugar. Avoid drinking too many fluids. If a person wakes up in the middle of the night, they should not have a snack, or this may become a habit that signals the body to wake up for food at night.

A light snack like crackers or milk requires energy to digest and can make a person feel sleepy. Sugar is a stimulant, however, and interferes with sleep. Too many fluids before bed may cause a person to wake up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.

## Screen 17
Review these sleep rules, and make plans to practice them. You can pick up a copy of these sleep guidelines at this time to refer to at home as needed.

## Screen 18
There are several more skills that can help a person teach their body to fall asleep more quickly.

## Screen 19
First, a person should not go to bed until they are sleepy.

Their body will learn that their bed is connected to feeling sleepy, and they will fall asleep faster. Going to bed when a person is not sleepy will teach the body that the bed is connected with feeling alert, and it will take longer to fall asleep.

## Screen 20
Get up at approximately the same time each morning, including weekends. Get up no more than 1 hour later, even on weekends.

Waking up at about the same time each morning makes the body become sleepy at about the same time each night.

## Screen 21
Do not take naps.

If a person naps during the daytime they may not feel sleepy at bedtime.

## Screen 22
Do not use the bed or bedroom for any activity other than sleep. Do not read, watch television, talk on the telephone, worry, argue with a spouse, or eat in bed.

If a person only sleeps in their bed, their body will associate the bed with sleep and they will fall asleep faster. Doing other activities while in bed (e.g., eating) teaches the body to feel restless (e.g., hungry) when in bed.

## Screen 23
Set up a regular pre-sleep routine that signals that bedtime is approaching. Locking the door, brushing one’s teeth, and setting the alarm are all behaviors that make sense for this time of night. Remember to get in a comfortable sleep posture and use favorite pillows and blankets.

A regular routine before bed will teach the body to feel sleepy as the routine is carried out. The specific steps in a bedtime routine will become connected with the sleepy feeling that happens just before falling asleep.

## Screen 24
When a person gets into bed, they should turn out the lights with the plan of going right to sleep. If they cannot fall asleep within a short time (about 10-20 minutes), they should get up and go into another room. They should do a quiet activity until they begin to feel drowsy, and then return to the bedroom for sleep.

Again, if someone stays in bed when they are not drowsy, the body will learn to associate being in bed with feeling alert, which will interfere with falling asleep.

## Screen 25
This process can be repeated as often as necessary throughout the night. The same procedure should be used if a person wakes up in the middle of the night and can’t fall back to sleep within about 10 minutes.

## Screen 26
A common concern of many people is that these sleep guidelines (not going to bed until they feel drowsy, getting up at the same time every day, and no naps) will cause them to not get enough sleep. Some people are worried that they will not be able to work or go to school. It is important to remember that this is the best way to find out how much sleep a person needs to function well.

## Screen 27
Using this program may cause a person to sleep less in the beginning. Eventually their body will adjust and get on a regular schedule. A person may not function at their best during this beginning period, but it will be short-lived and will lead to better sleep patterns.

## Screen 28
Remember, for this program to help improve sleep habits, it is important to follow the sleep guidelines every day.

# Lesson - Receiving Criticism

## Screen 1
Conflict is an ordinary part of life. We are just as likely to receive criticism from others as we are to give it. Learning to accept criticism is an important skill to learn that can help one resolve conflict.

## Screen 2
It can sometimes be difficult to receive criticism calmly; however, learning to accept feedback from others allows us to make personal changes and learn more about ourselves. These changes can have a positive effect on our lives and relationships.

## Screen 3
Receiving criticism in an appropriate way lets others know that we are open to change and compromise. It lets the person know that his or her opinions and feelings matter. It also allows us to avoid unnecessary arguments and sets the stage for honest communication. Once somebody sees that you are open to feedback and that you both can work together to resolve problems, it will make it easier to handle future problems.

## Screen 4
People can give criticism in both appropriate and inappropriate ways. Regardless of how it is offered, it is important to be open and not to react in a hostile way. The two types of criticism are constructive and destructive criticism.

## Screen 5
**Constructive** (or assertive) criticism is the most appropriate approach to offering criticism. It points out the problem behavior and does not degrade the person. The focus is on one's feelings and asks for a change of behavior.

## Screen 6
**Destructive** (or aggressive) criticism occurs when someone personalizes your behavior and attacks you rather than your behavior. This criticism can often lead to fighting and resentment.

## Screen 7
Here are some guidelines to help you receive criticism in an appropriate and effective way.

## Screen 8
If the criticism is presented in a negative or destructive manner, it may be useful to ask the person giving the criticism to restate in a more constructive manner. You are in control of how you respond, even if the person is trying to argue with you.

## Screen 9
Avoid getting defensive or debating the issue. This approach just escalates the behavior and decreases the chances of effective communication between the individual involved.

## Screen 10
Make sure you are clear about the criticism. Donâ€™t be afraid to ask clarifying questions in order to better understand the nature of the comments. Again, this will increase positive communication with the other person.

## Screen 11
Accept the criticism that you agree with and rephrase in a positive way if necessary. Approaching the criticism in this manner will minimize negativity.

## Screen 12
Compromise if necessary. When a person asks to change your behavior, compromise may be necessary. Offer changes that you are willing to make to improve the situation. This often sets up a win-win situation.

## Screen 13
If you absolutely do not agree with the criticism, reject it in a positive way. Be firm, yet polite in your response.

## Screen 14
Receiving criticism effectively and appropriately can prevent arguments and negative feelings. If you can learn to accept feedback and resolve issues, this will help you avoid high-risk situations that may lead you to relapsing to alcohol or drug use.

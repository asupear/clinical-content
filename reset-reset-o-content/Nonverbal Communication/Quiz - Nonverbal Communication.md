# Quiz - Nonverbal Communication

+ One way of explaining "nonverbal communication" is _____________.
+ The term "nonverbal communication" can be described as _____________.

### Answers
+ the words we speak
+ __our body language and the way we communicate__
+ how we phrase a question

### Explanation
Nonverbal communication is sometimes called "body language" and affects your communication with others. Nonverbal communication refers to the way you express yourself with your body and tone of voice. This is different than verbal communication, which refers to what is being said when interacting with others.

## Question 2

### Prompts - Multiple Choice
+ Someone’s "personal space" refers to _____________.
+ The term "personal space" describes ____________.
+ "Personal space" is a term used to refer to the space______________.

### Answers
+ one’s own living situation
+ __the distance surrounding a person that feels comfortable without others moving into that area__
+ the desire to be left alone
+ a storage space

### Explanation
Another important skill involved in good nonverbal communication is maintaining an appropriate personal space. When talking with someone, it is important to keep a comfortable distance between you and the other person - not too far away and not too close. In our culture, individuals have a "personal space" of about 1 square foot surrounding their bodies. 

Standing too close to someone may make him or her feel like you are pressuring them. You may have heard of the phrase "invading my space". This means that another person feels like their personal space has been violated or that another person is standing too close to them. Also, if you stand too far away from another person, you may appear disinterested.

## Question 3

### Prompts - Multiple Choice
+ Which item is not an example of positive, non-verbal behavior _____________?
+ Each of the following is an example of positive, nonverbal communication except __________.
+ Which of the following does not model positive, nonverbal communication?

### Answers
+ calm tone of voice
+ open and relaxed posture
+ facial expressions that match the message
+ __loud, sarcastic laughter__

### Explanation
Developing a relaxed posture is one important skill for good nonverbal communication. A relaxed posture looks natural to others and should feel comfortable to you. An open posture, without crossed arms, shows people that you're open and willing to communicate. Sitting, with your arms resting on the arm rests or at your sides with relaxed hands, is one type of a welcoming position.

Initiating eye contact as well as receiving eye contact while talking with others is also an important aspect of nonverbal communication. When people talk to each other, they hold each other's attention not only by what they are saying, but also by frequently looking into each other's eyes. Not looking at a person while they are talking makes them feel that you aren't listening or that you don't want to have a conversation with them.

Maintaining an appropriate tone of voice is important in communication. A low tone of voice that can barely be heard has a much different interpretation than a loud, sarcastic tone of voice. The most effective tone of voice is firm, calm, and relaxed.

An open posture, without crossed arms, shows people that you’re open and willing to communicate. Sitting, with your arms resting on the arm rests or at your sides with relaxed hands, is one type of a welcoming position.

Many people have difficulty finding a relaxed position when standing. One easy way to do this is to distribute your weight evenly when standing. When doing this, you are much less likely to rock back and forth, an action that can be very distracting to the person you are talking to and may make them think that you feel nervous or uncomfortable.

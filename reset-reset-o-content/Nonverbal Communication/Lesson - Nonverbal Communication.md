# Lesson - Nonverbal Communication

## Screen 1
Nonverbal communication is sometimes called "body language" and affects your communication with others. Nonverbal communication refers to the way you express yourself with your body and tone of voice. This is different than verbal communication, which refers to what is being said when interacting with others.

## Screen 2
Nonverbal communication can influence how your message is interpreted. For example, if you respond to someone who asks you to use drugs by speaking softly, looking around the room and appearing restless, this will not send a clear message that you do not want to use drugs with them. They may continue to ask or pressure you to use with them.

## Screen 3
Sometimes a person's words and actions can have very different meanings. For example, a person’s words may not match the expression on their face. This is sometimes referred to as giving "mixed messages". For example, if someone is smiling while they tell you that they just got in a car accident, this may seem like a mixed message to you.

## Screen 4
Paying close attention to your nonverbal behavior can greatly improve your interactions with other people. It will increase the chances that others will respond positively to you.

## Screen 5
You may be unaware of your body language. Body language can become automatic or habitual. You might not be aware of the effect that you are having on the other person you are communicating with.

In this section of the program, we will discuss several different types of nonverbal behavior and help you identify those types that may help you become more skilled at effective nonverbal communication.

## Screen 6
Developing a relaxed posture is one important skill for good nonverbal communication. A relaxed posture looks natural to others and should feel comfortable to you. An open posture, without crossed arms, shows people that you’re open and willing to communicate. Sitting, with your arms resting on the arm rests or at your sides with relaxed hands, is one type of a welcoming position.

## Screen 7
Many people have difficulty finding a relaxed position when standing. One easy way to do this is to distribute your weight evenly when standing. When doing this, you are much less likely to rock back and forth, an action that can be very distracting to the person you are talking to and may make them think that you feel nervous or uncomfortable.

## Screen 8
People that are shy, frequently turn away from the person with whom they are talking. If you do this, it may give the message that you are not interested or are uncomfortable talking with the other person. To avoid giving this message, you should stand or sit facing the person(s) you are speaking with, or at least face them at a slight angle.

## Screen 9
Another important skill involved in good nonverbal communication is maintaining an appropriate personal space. When talking with someone, it is important to keep a comfortable distance between you and the other person - not too far away and not too close. In our culture, individuals have a "personal space" of about 1 square foot surrounding their bodies.

Standing too close to someone may make him or her feel like you are pressuring them. You may have heard of the phrase “invading my space”. This means that another person feels like their personal space has been violated or that another person is standing too close to them. Also, if you stand too far away from another person, you may appear disinterested.

## Screen 10
If you intrude on another individual's personal space when talking with them, they may feel uncomfortable or anxious. In this situation, either you or your listener may focus on trying to increase the distance between the two of you instead of focusing on the conversation. To avoid this problem, try to remember that a comfortable distance is at least 2 feet, which is the sum of your square foot (personal space) and the square foot of the person with whom you are interacting.

## Screen 11
Initiating eye contact as well as receiving eye contact while talking with others is also an important aspect of nonverbal communication. When people talk to each other, they hold each other’s attention not only by what they are saying, but also by frequently looking into each other’s eyes. Not looking at a person while they are talking makes them feel that you aren’t listening or that you don’t want to have a conversation with them.

## Screen 12
Eye contact shows a person that you are following what is being said and that you are interested in talking. However, too much eye contact can also be disruptive because the other person may feel like you are staring at them. Making eye contact a little more than half of the time during a conversation is generally appropriate.

## Screen 13
A head nod is important in nonverbal communication. A head nod is an effective nonverbal behavior that lets the person you are speaking to know that you are paying attention. By nodding your head, you convey to the speaker that you understand what is being said. Shaking your head "yes" or "no" is also a method of communicating without words.

## Screen 14
It is also important that your facial expression agrees with what you are saying. As mentioned earlier, nonverbal behavior that is inconsistent with your words can give the other person a "mixed message".

An ear to ear grin while you are making an apology will probably make the other person confused. That is because the grin makes your statement seem less sincere.

## Screen 15
A pleasing expression on your face can help create a more relaxed atmosphere. This expression lets the other person know that you are enjoying speaking with him/her. It sends the message that you are approachable.

## Screen 16
Nervous movements are NOT effective in nonverbal communication. Some of your nervous movements will begin to decrease as you practice the communications skills that are covered in this program. However, nervous or distracting gestures that have become long-standing habits should be identified, so that you can make efforts to change them.

Examples of some nervous movements are twirling your hair, tapping your fingers, or moving your knee rapidly up and down. These movements are distracting and send the message that you may be uncomfortable.

## Screen 17
Being aware of these distracting movements make it possible for you to change your behavior. For example, if you know that you have a habit of playing with your hair while you speak, focus on resting your hands at your side while speaking.

## Screen 18
Hand gestures can be a way to emphasize what is being said; however, certain hand gestures or too many hand gestures can have a negative or distracting effect on the conversation. For example, finger pointing is often interpreted as a controlling gesture.

## Screen 19
Maintaining an appropriate tone of voice is important in communication. A low tone of voice that can barely be heard has a much different interpretation than a loud, sarcastic tone of voice. The most effective tone of voice is firm, calm, and relaxed.

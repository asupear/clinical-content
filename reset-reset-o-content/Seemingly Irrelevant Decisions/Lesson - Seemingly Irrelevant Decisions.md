# Lesson - Seemingly Irrelevant Decisions

## Screen 1
Many of the choices you make on a daily basis may seem to have nothing to do with using drugs. Although these decisions may not involve making a direct choice of whether to use drugs, they may lead you closer to being faced with a choice about drug use.

## Screen 2
Without proper planning, a series of everyday decisions may gradually lead you closer to the point at which using becomes very likely. These seemingly unimportant decisions, that may actually put you on the road to using drugs, are called "seemingly irrelevant decisions" or SIDs.

## Screen 3
People often think of themselves as victims and think that things just happen to them in such a way that they end up in a high-risk situation and then have to use drugs because they couldn't help it. Many people don't realize how many of their everyday decisions, over a period of time, gradually brought them closer and closer to a high-risk situation, because so many choices don’t actually seem to involve using drugs at the time.

## Screen 4
You should think about every choice you have to make, no matter how seemingly irrelevant it is to using drugs. By thinking ahead and considering all the options you have and where each of them may lead, you can anticipate risks that may lie along certain paths. As you continue to think and plan ahead, after a while, it becomes second nature and happens automatically, without much effort. You'll find that it will be worth the effort you will have to make, because your effort will help you increase your control over your abstinence from drugs.

## Screen 5
By paying more attention to the decision making process, you will have a greater chance to interrupt the chain of decisions that could lead to a relapse. This is important because it is much easier to stop the process early, before you wind up in a high-risk situation, rather than later when you are in a situation that is harder to handle and may expose you to a number of triggers.

## Screen 6
When you are faced with a decision, you should generally choose a low-risk option, to avoid putting yourself in a risky situation. If for some reason, you decide to select a high-risk option, you must also plan how to protect yourself while in the high-risk situation.

## Screen 7
To illustrate how some seemingly minor decisions can lead to a relapse, one client called "George" was being treated for drug dependence.

Imagine George walking down a dimly lit city sidewalk close to midnight. As he walks, he reaches into his pocket for a cigarette and discovers that he is out. He anxiously looks around the streets for a store where he can buy some more. A flashing red, neon light catches his eye and he begins walking briskly toward it. As he draws closer, he realizes that the red neon sign reads ‘BEER.’ He pauses only a moment to deliberate, deciding that he really needs a cigarette so he’ll go into the bar to get a pack.

He enters the bar and goes to the cigarette vending machine. Reaching into his pants pocket, he finds no coins. After asking two grey-haired men playing pool if they could change a dollar and seeing two heads shaking ‘no’ in unison, he turns toward the cash register near the bar to get change. Amid the clacking of billiard balls, he hears his name, ‘George!’ Turning toward the sound, he stares into drifting blue cigarette smoke and recognizes his foreman from the foundry. The foreman instantly turns to the bartender saying, ‘Get a beer for George.’ Debating only a second, George sips his first taste of foaming beer. George, being a recovering alcoholic, was able to limit himself to two beers, before excusing himself. He felt proud of himself as he walked home. It was late so he took a short cut which led him by a friend’s house whom he used to use drug with.

He thought to himself, I "did good tonight," being able to stop after two beers and thought further, "I can only do one line - I deserve it. I’ve been clean for so long - one bag won’t hurt." His friend greeted him with a big smile and slap on the back as he ushered him inside. Three other old friends were there and they all had been using. They asked if he wanted a line and he thought again and said "sure."

Two days later, he used again with them and that was the beginning a full blown relapse.

## Screen 8
Did George really have to have a cigarette? Did he have no alternative but to enter the bar? Could he have said ‘no’ to the beer his foreman bought him?

Thoughts like "I have to" go to a party, "I should" see a certain buddy who uses drugs, or "I have to" drive by a particular place, often occur at the beginning of a SID and should be treated as a warning or red flag.

## Screen 9
It is important to consider how your own SIDs could eventually lead to a relapse.

Think about the last time you slipped or relapsed to drug use after a period of abstinence, and to describe the situation and events that preceded the slip/relapse. Indicate which of the following decisions led up to the relapse situation:

## Screen 10
Although many of these decisions may seem like minor decisions, they may actually contribute to whether or not you relapse to drug use. You do not necessarily have to choose the “safe” alternative when making each of these decisions, but you should at least be aware that you are making a choice that allows you to enter a high-risk relapse situation, so that you may make preparations to cope with it effectively.

## Screen 11
When making any decision, whether large or small, do the following:
- Consider what options you may have.
- Think ahead to the possible outcomes of each option. What positive or negative consequences can you anticipate, and what are the risks or relapse?
- Select one of the options, and choose one that will minimize your relapse risk.
- If you decide to choose a risky option, plan how to protect yourself while in the high-risk situation.

## Screen 12
At this point, think about what plans you have made for this weekend? If you haven't made any plans, consider why you haven't and consider whether not having a plan can be a SID. Sometimes not planning means planning to use. Consider what plans you could make for this weekend that would reduce your risk of winding up in a risky situation.

## Screen 13
Remember: Carefully consider all decisions that you make to avoid making seemingly irrelevant decisions that could place you in a high-risk situation.

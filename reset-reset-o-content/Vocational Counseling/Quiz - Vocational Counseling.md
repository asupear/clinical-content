# Quiz - Vocational Counseling

## Question 1

### Prompts - Multiple Choice
+ One of the predictors of having long-term success after substance abuse treatment is having a stable, satisfying _____________.
+ Vocational counseling is an important part of treatment because having a rewarding ________________ can help with long-term recovery.
+ Having a steady, enjoyable _________ is one of the predictors of long-term success in drug treatment.

### Answers
+ hobby
+ friend
+ __job__
+ car

### Explanation
One of the predictors of having long-term success after substance abuse treatment is having a stable, satisfying job. This relationship between drug abstinence and job satisfaction occurs because:

- When you work at a job you like, you are unlikely to use opioids or other drugs while working. You do not want to take the chance that your boss will notice you are high, or that you will not be as productive.
- You are less likely to run the risk of losing that job by coming in late or missing work because of late-night drug use.
- The job makes you take pride in and feel good about yourself.
- The job provides you with money to access other positive things, such as social and recreational activities, and good housing and transportation.

## Question 2

### Prompts - Multiple Choice
+ By the end of the first session of vocational counseling, you should have set specific long-term and short-term _________.
+ After your first vocational counseling session you should have listed specific long-term and short-term _____________.
+ Long-term and short-term __________ should be set during your first vocational counseling session.

### Answers
+ hobbies
+ friends
+ jobs
+ __goals__

### Explanation
By the end of the first session of vocational counseling you should set both a long-term vocational goal (for example, to get a full-time job as a secretary) as well as specific, short-term achievable goals (for example, apply for 5 jobs per week, sign up for work at a temporary agency, or start a computer skills class). These short-term goals should be monitored and changed, as needed, until you meet your long-term goal. In this respect, vocational counseling is typically an ongoing part of your treatment.

# Lesson - Vocational Counseling

## Screen 1
Having a satisfying job or career can play an important role in achieving and maintaining abstinence from opioids and other drugs of abuse. Therefore, vocational counseling is an important part of substance abuse treatment.

## Screen 2
Vocational counseling focuses on helping you locate work. It can also improve your employment situation if your job is unsatisfactory, or if you have a job that places you at high risk for continued drug use.

## Screen 3
One of the predictors of having long-term success after substance abuse treatment is having a stable, satisfying job. This relationship between drug abstinence and job satisfaction occurs because:

- When you work at a job you like, you are unlikely to use opioids or other drugs while working. You do not want to take the chance that your boss will notice you are high, or that you will not be as productive.
- You are less likely to run the risk of losing that job by coming in late or missing work because of late-night drug use.
- The job makes you take pride in and feel good about yourself.
- The job provides you with money to access other positive things, such as social and recreational activities, and good housing and transportation.
- Sometimes the job also provides a source of social support, friendship, and social activities that are unrelated to drug use. This may include a staff picnic, retreat, or softball team.

## Screen 4
The primary goal of vocational counseling is to help you find a satisfying job or to take steps toward developing a meaningful career. The goals of vocational counseling will vary depending on your situation. Below are examples of goals that are typically set as part of vocational counseling.

## Screen 5
If you are unemployed, your vocational goals during treatment may include:

- apply for 8 jobs per week
- write a resume
- mail out two resumes with a cover letter each day
- start a job training program
- start a vocational exploration program
- take a class related to developing job-skills
- learn and think about educational programs

## Screen 6
If you work "too many" hours or have an irregular schedule, your vocational goals may include:

- try to work only 35 - 50 hours each week
- set a more regular work schedule
- think of other possible work schedules

## Screen 7
If you work in a "high risk for drug use" environment or feel unhappy at your present job, your vocational goals may include:

- think about changing jobs 
- put in applications at other advertised jobs while you continue to work
- change the work environment to reduce risk of drug use, or improve working conditions
- take a career exploration class
- sign up for job-skills or alternative career-related educational classes

## Screen 8
By the end of the first session of vocational counseling you should set both a long-term vocational goal (for example, to get a full-time job as a secretary) as well as specific, short-term achievable goals (for example, apply for 5 jobs per week, sign up for work at a temporary agency, or start a computer skills class). These short-term goals should be monitored and changed, as needed, until you meet your long-term goal. In this respect, vocational counseling is typically an ongoing part of your treatment.

## Screen 9
In order to find a job, you should carry out the following steps.

## Screen 10
Treat the job search as a full-time job. In doing this, you should spend about half of each workday looking for job leads and setting up interviews. The other half of the day is set aside for going to interviews. Continue with this schedule each day until you find a job.

## Screen 11
Keep in regular contact with friends, relatives, and acquaintances that may have ideas about job leads.

## Screen 12
Your therapist can provide you with standard scripts and forms to follow when you make contacts with potential employers, write letters, make telephone calls, and keep records during your job search.

Your therapist can help you find the supplies and services you need for a job search. These may include picking a work area, and access to a telephone, computer, photocopier, postage, and newspapers.

## Screen 13
Look for jobs that are advertised, as well as jobs that may not be advertised. For example, you could call all the manufacturing plants, all the car dealerships, or all the haircutting businesses in the yellow pages.

## Screen 14
Use the telephone as your primary way of getting job leads. This is a more efficient method than writing letters or making visits.

## Screen 15
Use the yellow pages section of the telephone book to make lists of potential employers.

## Screen 16
You should promote your strengths, such as your social and personal skills, in addition to your work skills or training when looking for a job. These skills can be highlighted in a resume or application, as well as during interviews. You should also identify and list useful work-related skills that you have that you did not necessarily develop in your previous jobs.

You should also make the most of unsuccessful job contacts. That is, you may wish to ask businesses that do not hire you for other potential job leads. This can be as simple as asking, "Do you know of any other businesses that are hiring now?"

## Screen 17
You should re-contact a potential job source following an interview (for example, by letter or phone). This can help show your interest and enthusiasm for the job to the potential employer. Also, if you’ve been turned down for a job that you thought you would really enjoy, you should call that employer back after a period of time to ask about future job opportunities.

## Screen 18
Make sure that you have transportation to job sites that are difficult to get to for whatever reason.

## Screen 19
Contact previous employers for jobs or job leads.

## Screen 20
Ask for general letters of recommendation from multiple sources. Use these when submitting applications or when interviewing to speed up a potential employer’s decision.

## Screen 21
Make sure that you have an effective, updated resume.

Your therapist can provide advice and instruction on how to effectively fill out an application (for example, how to emphasize personal skills). Additionally, you may be able to find books in the library that offer useful advice on how to fill our job applications.

These same resources may also be useful in providing you with a list of effective behaviors that should occur during an interview, such as how to dress and what you should bring with you. Before and after each interview, you should review this list.

## Screen 22
If you cannot find a job in a reasonable amount of time you could place a job-wanted ad in the newspaper. This ad should list your personal skills and the type of work you are seeking.

## Screen 23
When looking for a job, be sure to follow a structured job-seeking schedule. You should use a date book or form to schedule each day’s activities. This will help you stay organized.

## Screen 24
You should keep records using job lead lists, callbacks, and progress notes. Keep all of these records in one place, so you don’t waste time searching for a number when you need it.

## Screen 25
Contact job supervisors rather than personnel staff. Often the supervisor has an important role in making hiring decisions.

## Screen 26
You may want to talk with your therapist about the best way to discuss your weaknesses (such as any physical limitations, prison record). You may be asked to share your weaknesses at a job interview. There are strategies to turn your weaknesses into strengths, or at least show how you have managed them in the past.

## Screen 27
When looking for a job, consider a variety of jobs. Do not restrict yourself so much that you do not find employment. Stay open to many job options to increase your chances of finding employment faster.

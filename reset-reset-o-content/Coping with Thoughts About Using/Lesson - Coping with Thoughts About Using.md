## Screen 3
Second, be aware of the persistent thoughts that would lead you to make excuses for and justify the use of drugs.

## Screen 4
Finally, always pay attention to potential risks for relapse.  Never assume that you are exempt from the possibility of giving into urges, cravings, or thoughts of using.

## Screen 5
The following behaviors will help you manage thoughts about using.

## Screen 6
**Challenge your thoughts.**
Ask yourself, "Do you really need to get high?  Will you really not have fun without getting high?" Argue with your thoughts about using drugs.

For example, "I can't just take one hit and stop, my use always starts increasing pretty quickly.   I don't have to use to unwind after work.  I can relax with music, go for a walk, do some relaxation exercises, or a million other things."

## Screen 7
**Think of the benefits of not using.**
Think about the personal benefits of staying clean.  This may include better physical health, improved family life, greater job stability, more money for recreation and paying bills, increased self-esteem, and a sense of self-control.

It is important to pay attention to the positive aspects of sobriety and the progress you are making.   Do not focus on what you seem to be giving up.

## Screen 8
**Remember unpleasant using experiences and after-effects.**
Try to recall the pain, anxiety, embarrassment, and other negative feelings associated with using.  Remember images of fights with loved ones or trouble with the law.  These images will act as vivid reminders of what your drug use can lead to.

## Screen 9
**Distraction.**
Think about something unrelated to drugs.  Think about pleasant and enjoyable topics.  Focus on a task you want to get done.

## Screen 10
**Remind yourself of your success so far.**
Remember successes like the amount of time that you have been abstinent or the times that you have resisted urges.  Think of the effort that you made to get in and stay in treatment.

## Screen 11
**Use images of riding out the urge until it passes.**
Try not to fight this feeling but acknowledge the feeling until it passes.  Remember that it is normal to have thoughts of using.  Take control of your actions.

## Screen 12
**Delay the decision to use.**
If nothing else is working, then look at your watch and put off decision to use for 15 minutes or more.  Remember that most urges are like waves, they build to a peak and then decline.

## Screen 13
**Leave or change the situation.**
Try a different activity, such as a hobby or physical exercise.  Starting another activity will help you think of something other than drugs.  Try an activity that requires your full attention.

## Screen 14
**Call someone and try to talk it out.**
If you are thinking about using drugs, call someone who has been helpful to you in the past.  Talk with them about your desire to use drugs.  This person can remind you of the positive and negative aspects of your drug use.  You could also invite them to join you in an activity that would distract you.

## Screen 15
Using these strategies can help you manage your thoughts about drug use.  You can gain control of your response to these thoughts.  This can help you achieve long-term success in recovery.

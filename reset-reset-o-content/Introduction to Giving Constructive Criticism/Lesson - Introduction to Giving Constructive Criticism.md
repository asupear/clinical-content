# Lesson - Introduction to Giving Constructive Criticism

## Screen 1
Conflict is a part of every day life. Arguments with spouses or loved ones, disagreements with co-workers, or negative interactions with others can occur without warning. Knowing how to handle conflict in an effective way is an important skill.

## Screen 2
Giving constructive criticism is a communication skill that is a useful response to unsatisfactory or displeasing behavior by another person. It is important to discuss your concerns about these behaviors with the other person in an appropriate way without becoming needlessly angry or hurtful.

## Screen 3
Giving constructive criticism can be difficult for several reasons. It may be uncomfortable not knowing how the other person will react to the criticism. It may also be difficult for people who lack assertiveness skills, who are afraid of upsetting others, or who are concerned about being thought of in a negative way by others.

## Screen 4
There are a number of reasons to give constructive criticism. Ideally, constructive criticism can be used to build stronger, more fulfilling relationships with others.

## Screen 5
One reason to give constructive criticism is to make people aware of irritating behavior. They may not realize that they are engaging in this behavior, so you are possibly doing them a favor by telling them.

## Screen 6
A second reason to give constructive criticism is to prevent feelings of resentment. Over time, tolerating negative behavior may lead to anger and tension, which can create further problems in a relationship.

## Screen 7
Finally, being able to give constructive criticism may improve your communication with another person. Being honest and sincere may improve your relationships with others.

Some people think that using drugs and alcohol may make it easier to confront a person about their disturbing behavior. In reality, drug and alcohol use is self-destructive and can impair your judgment and/or your ability to remain calm and objective. It is important to practice these communication skills when not under the influence of drugs or alcohol in order to learn skills that will support a healthy, drug-free lifestyle.

Ignoring annoying behaviors may lead to an increased risk of drug use or relapse. Anger and frustration may be triggers or high-risk attitudes that can lead to drug or alcohol use.

# Lesson - Introduction to Anger Management

## Screen 1
Anger is a normal human emotion that we all have in common. The way we express our anger, however, differs from person to person and results in varying consequences. Some people “hold on to” their anger and are seen as passive. Others may be extremely aggressive or take their anger out in a passive-aggressive or indirect way.

## Screen 2
The following is a model of anger that identifies the relationship between the thoughts, feelings and behaviors that may occur when one is angry.

Trigger event -> Angry thoughts and feelings -> Behavior

## Screen 3
Understanding the events that may trigger angry thoughts and feelings and how those thoughts and feelings, in turn, affect one’s behavior are important in understanding how to effectively deal with anger.

## Screen 4
Acting on angry feelings can lead to positive or negative consequences.

## Screen 5
One negative effect of anger is confusion. This can result in impulsive actions and poor decision-making.

## Screen 6
Another negative effect of anger is aggression. Aggressive acts are often seen as threats or abuse. Acting in this manner may create fear in another person and may break down communication.

## Screen 7
A third negative effect of anger may occur when one has a passive or avoidant reaction to anger. Reacting in this manner may trigger depression and resentment, perhaps leading to further unhealthy behaviors.

## Screen 8
One positive effect of anger is that one can use feelings of anger to signal problematic situations and energize the person to resolve them.

## Screen 9
Another positive effect of anger would occur if one responds assertively to the situation that produced feelings of anger. This means standing up for one’s right if conflict with another person should arise, while also respecting the rights of the other person. This also means being willing to compromise with another person.

## Screen 10
Assertiveness tends to increase one’s personal power. When one responds assertively, conflict situations are often diffused and lines of communication are opened.

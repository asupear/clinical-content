# Lesson - Introduction to Managing Thoughts about Using

## Screen 1
Thoughts about using drugs are normal for people that recently stopped using.  The main problem with thinking about using is the risk of acting on these thoughts.  This could lead to a full relapse. The purpose of this session is for you to identify the thoughts or feelings that can lead you to using drugs, and then to learn some new ways to stop yourself before you actually slip.

## Screen 2
There are a number of situations where former drug users have thoughts about using.  Some of the more common situations are listed below.

## Screen 3
*Nostalgia*.  Some people think about using as if it were some long-lost friend.  For example, "I remember the good old days when my friends and I would sit around, use drugs and discuss the meaning of life."  They only think about the positive aspects of drug use and ignore the negative aspects.

## Screen 4
*Testing control*.  Sometimes, after a period of being sober, ex-users can become overconfident and try to test their ability to stay clean.  Curiosity can also be a problem because it can lead to risky behaviors.  Using "just once" can lead to a full-blown relapse.

## Screen 5
*Crisis*.  During stress or crisis, an ex-user may say "I need to use drugs," or "I can only handle this when I'm high," or "I went through too much upset, I deserve some dope."

## Screen 6
*Feeling uncomfortable when sober*.  Some people find that new problems arise after they become sober.  They think it would help to resume using in order to end those new problems.  For example, "I'm no fun to be around when I'm not high.  I don't think I should stop using, because if I do, people won't enjoy or like me as much."

## Screen 7
*Self-doubts*.  Some people may doubt their ability to succeed. For example: "I just have no willpower," or "I've tried to quit many times before and none of those efforts worked out; why should I expect this one to last?"

## Screen 8
*Escape*.  Individuals wish to avoid the discomfort from unpleasant situations, conflicts, or memories.  People want relief from feelings of failure, rejection, hurt, embarrassment, or sadness.  People get tired of feeling lousy and upset.  They just want to get away from it all and get away from themselves.  It is not necessarily that they want to get high, but that they want to feel peace and to escape from problems.

## Screen 9
*Relaxation*.  Thoughts of wanting to unwind are perfectly normal; however, the desire to relax is often connected to using drugs.  Instead of getting involved in a wide variety of enjoyable and relaxing activities, people may choose the more immediate relaxation from alcohol or drug use.

## Screen 10
*Socialization*.  This situation overlaps with relaxation but is limited to social situations.  Many people who are shy or uncomfortable in social settings may feel the need to use drugs in order to feel more relaxed.  They also may feel that drug use decreases the awkwardness and pressure they feel around others.

## Screen 11
*Improved self-image*.  This situation usually applies to people with low self-esteem.  Individuals may start to feel like using when they are unhappy with themselves or when they are feeling inferior to others.  They may also think of using when they feel unattractive or incompetent.  In the past, drug use may have eased the discomfort of low self-esteem.

## Screen 12
*Romance*.  When people are bored or unhappy with their lives they may yearn for excitement, romance, and the thrill of being in love.  The idea of romance takes their mind off their drug problems.  Some people may think that using drugs may help make fantasies more vivid and real.

## Screen 13
*"To heck with it."*  Some individuals seem to have lost all incentive for pursuing any worthwhile goals.  They may feel like nothing really matters.  There is no reason to try.  Why should they care?  This kind of attitude may lead these individuals to the use of drugs.

## Screen 14
*No control*.  Instead of individuals trying to "test their self-control", some people feel that they have no control of their drug use.   In this case, someone is almost certain to relapse to drug use. People who feel like they have no control do not even try to manage their thoughts of using, because they have already accepted defeat.  They feel powerless.

## Screen 15
Once you know how your own thoughts of using can impact your goal of recovery, you can learn to control these thoughts.  Managing thoughts of drug use can help you achieve long-term success in recovery.

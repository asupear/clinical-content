# Lesson - How to Become More Aware of the Feeling of Anger

## Screen 1
Being aware of the feeling of anger is the first step in being able to manage anger appropriately.

## Screen 2
There are two types of "anger" triggers, direct and indirect.

## Screen 3
**Direct triggers** might include a personal attack on you either physically or verbally. Examples include being yelled at by someone, being assaulted, or being scolded.

## Screen 4
**Indirect triggers** might include observing a physical or verbal attack on someone else. Indirect triggers may also include the way in which you perceive a situation (for example, feeling that you are being blamed, thinking that someone is disapproving of you, or feeling reactions that signal anger).

## Screen 5
Many people experience similar internal reactions when becoming angry in response to indirect or direct triggers of anger.

## Screen 6
These internal reactions may include the following:

- Feelings of frustration, irritation, feeling insulted, treated unfairly, agitated, or "on the verge". These feelings often precede anger, and therefore should be addressed before they build up and become more difficult to control or get out of hand

## Screen 7
Internal reactions to anger may also include: 

- Physical reactions such as muscle tension, headache, pounding heart, sweating, rapid breathing, clenched fist, or a red face

## Screen 8
Additional internal reactions to anger may include:

- Difficulty getting to sleep due to angry thoughts and feelings stored up during the day

- Feelings of depression and fatigue. Also, if past attempts to express anger have not been effective for a person, he or she may experience feelings of helplessness.

## Screen 9
Becoming aware of these feelings of anger is an important step in anger management. Only by recognizing and understanding feelings of anger can one begin to control these feelings as well as how one acts on these feelings.

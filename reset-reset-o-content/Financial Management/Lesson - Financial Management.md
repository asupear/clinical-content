# Lesson - Financial Management

## Screen 1
Learning the skills necessary to manage your financial resources is an important step in gaining control of your life. Debt is often a concern for those who have used drugs for a period of time and have neglected their finances.

## Screen 2
This section will focus on debt, current income, living expenses and planning a budget. It is important to remember that getting out of debt or even staying out of debt requires commitment, self- discipline and time.

## Screen 3
**DEBT**
The first step in managing your finances is to add up money you owe. Please pick up a "Debt Analysis Form" at this time. You can use this form to help identify your debts. Once you have listed any debts that you have, look at the outcomes of delaying or reducing the amount you pay toward each debt.

Would you lose your car if you failed to pay the next payment? Would your relative be willing to wait another month to be paid back? Do bill collectors call you often?

## Screen 4
Prioritize how important it is that you pay each debt you have on a scale of 1-5. Use 5 for the bills that are the most important to pay back. The debts that rank highest on this scale are the ones which you should plan to pay off first or the ones for which you should make larger payments on a monthly basis, if possible.

## Screen 5
**INCOME**
After identifying your debt, the second step in managing your finances is to write a list of all your income on a monthly basis. Do not include money you may receive from illegal sources or money you may get from a future settlement. Remember the goal is to have a sensible budget you can manage! 

You should pick up a "Review Your Finances" worksheet at this time and use it to help you figure your monthly income.

## Screen 6
**LIVING EXPENSES**
Once you have determined your monthly income, calculate your monthly living expenses using the “Review Your Finances” worksheet. Total all expenses that you pay including rent, electricity, food, credit cards, etc. If you share expenses, figure out only the portion that you pay. 

It would be helpful to carry a notebook to record money that you spend on a daily basis. Keep track of your expenses for one month. You will see that little items such as coffee in the morning add up!

## Screen 7
What if your expenses add up to more than your income? First, see if there are items on your expenditure list that you can reduce or get rid of altogether. Perhaps you could move to a less expensive apartment, or get a part-time job one or two nights a week. If you continue to spend more than you make, the amount of your debt will surely increase.

## Screen 8
Now that we have discussed debt, income and living expenses, you are ready to create a budget for yourself. Please pick up copies of the "Debt Analysis Form", the "Review Your Finances Form" and the "Summary of Instructions for the Financial Management forms".

You can use these forms in the following exercise.

## Screen 9
To create a budget, follow these steps:

1. Complete the "Debt Analysis Form".

a. List all of your debts in the first column.

b. In the second column, write down the total amount you owe.

c. In the third column, write down your required monthly payment.

d. Identify how many months you are behind in the payment.

## Screen 10
e. Lastly, in the pay back column, prioritize how important it is that you pay back each debt you have on a scale of 1-5. Use 5 to show the debts that need to be paid off the most. The debts that rank highest on this scale are those which you should plan to pay off first or those which you should pay more on a monthly basis, if possible.

## Screen 11
2. Complete the "Review Your Finances" worksheet in the following order.

a. **INCOME**: Total your monthly income from all legal sources.

b. **EXPENSES**: In the "Current Expenses Column," list all expenses that you are now paying each month.

c. Total the monthly expenses in the "Current Expenses Column".

d. Write down your "Total Monthly Income" in the first column following the listing of expenses.

e. Write down your "Total Monthly Expenses" below the "Total Income".

## Screen 12
f. Figure out the difference between your "Total Monthly Income" and "Total Monthly Expenses".

g. The difference is called a "cash gap". If you have a negative cash gap you need to identify what expenses, in addition to your debt, you can reduce in order to balance your budget.

h. Re-adjust your expenses based on your cash gap and after reviewing your "Debt Analysis Form". Top priority should be made for those debts with the highest pay back need.

i. List *all* adjusted expenses in the "Adjusted Monthly Expenses" column. Remember that in order to balance your budget, your Total Monthly Income must be equal to or more than your Total Monthly Expenses.

## Screen 13
j. If you have a positive cash gap, you may want to think about starting a savings account or perhaps paying off more of your debt.

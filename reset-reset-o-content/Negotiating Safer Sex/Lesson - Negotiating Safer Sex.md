# Lesson - Negotiating Safer Sex

## Screen 1
It can be very difficult to talk about sex with a partner and to set sexual limits. It can feel embarrassing and vulnerable, and there are few good role models on TV and in the movies of how to effectively talk with a partner about sex and safety.

## Screen 2
But talking with a sex partner is one of the most important steps in having safer sex. Communicating effectively with a partner about safer sex will help you to clearly express what you are willing or not willing to do, and get a better understanding of your partner’s opinions and feelings about the topic.

## Screen 3
Bringing up the subject of sex and safety with your partner can be one of the hardest parts of talking about it. It’s a good idea to bring it up at a time when both of you are relaxed, and when you are not in the middle of a sexual situation. It can be much harder to talk about safer sex for the first time with a partner when you are in the heat of the moment.

## Screen 4
It’s important to set your own personal limits about sex. A limit is a boundary or line that you set for yourself that you won’t cross. It is your own decision about how much risk you are willing to take in certain situations. Some of the limits you could choose include not having sex until you are in a committed relationship, and only having sex with a condom.

## Screen 5
When talking about safer sex, think about your goals and personal limits and refer to them either in your own mind, or as a part of the discussion. For example, you may say "I have promised myself that I will go to college, so I don’t want to take any risks now that might get in the way of that. That’s why I’ve decided that I will only have sex if we use a condom."

## Screen 6
Good communication is a skill that takes practice. Many people have trouble communicating or being assertive. But with practice you can get better at it. The result will be that you get your needs met more often, and you are better able to refuse what you don’t want.

## Screen 7
There are several different styles that people use to communicate. Each style can have different outcomes or results and can affect what you say, how you say it, and your body language.

## Screen 8
Passive communication is when you don’t really say what you want or feel. With passive communication, you may give in and say "yes" when you don’t really want to in order to avoid upsetting the other person, or because you want to be liked.

## Screen 9
When people communicate passively, their voice might be very soft; they may apologize a lot or say nothing at all. They may look down at the floor, and may be fidgety.

## Screen 10
We’re going to watch a video in which a young woman named Samantha really wants to have sex with her boyfriend Jeremy but she has set a personal limit of only having sex with a condom. Let’s watch Samantha try to talk to her boyfriend about using condoms.

## Screen 11
Samantha avoided a conflict by backing down when Jeremy resisted using a condom, but she ended up doing something she didn't really want to do. She did not make eye contact and her body language suggested that she was uncomfortable and unsure of herself. By being passive, she ended up crossing a line she didn't want to cross and put herself at risk.

## Screen 12
Aggressive communication is when you try to get your own way by putting other people down or using threats, without thinking about the other person’s feelings or needs. Aggressive people often say things like "you always..." or "you never..." making the issue about the other person, not about themselves.

## Screen 13
When people communicate aggressively, they may use a loud voice and have an angry tone, or be very cold and quiet. They may stare at you, and may stand with their hands on their hips or with fists clenched. Let’s watch Samantha again.

## Screen 14
Samantha really wanted to have sex with Jeremy, with a condom. Her angry tone and disregard for Jeremy's feelings turned him off and upset him enough that he decided to leave. Samantha ended up not having sex and potentially damaging or even losing her relationship with Jeremy.

## Screen 15
Assertive communication is when you say what you feel, need or want in a clear and straightforward way and listen to and respect what the other person feels, needs or wants. Assertive people use "I" statements like "I would feel more comfortable if..." or "I would like to...". This makes sure that you are using reasons for what you want that are about your needs, not about someone else’s. Assertive people don’t need to put other people down in order to get their needs met.

## Screen 16
When people are assertive, they speak clearly but not too loudly, look you directly in the eye (without staring) and are standing or sitting tall, but relaxed. Let’s watch Samantha try this approach.

## Screen 17
This time Samantha was respectful of Jeremy's feelings, and able to say how she felt and what she wanted in a strong, non-threatening way. She is getting what she wants and the relationship may be stronger because both people feel respected and listened to, and because Samantha feels safer.

## Screen 18
Assertive communication is the most effective way to get your needs met and to earn the respect of others. It can be hard to stick to your personal limits sometimes, but the more you practice being assertive, the easier it will become.

## Screen 19
These skills can also help you if someone asks you to have sex and you don’t want to. Remember, you can say no even if you have had sex before. You have the right to make choices that are right for you now, no matter what you have chosen to do in the past.

## Screen 20
Below are some suggestions that will help you say no more effectively.

- Use body language that is strong but not threatening.
- Make eye contact and use a firm voice.
- Clearly say no or no thank you.
- You don’t need to give reasons or excuses for saying no, but you could say "I’ve decided not to have sex for now".

## Screen 21
If you say no and someone keeps pressuring you to do something you don’t want to do, you can state how that person is making you feel or ask them why they keep pressuring you. If that doesn’t work, you can state that you won’t discuss it anymore and leave the situation.

## Screen 22
Sometimes even if you use assertive communication, someone may force you to do something you don’t want to do. If someone forces you to have sex against your will, they have committed a crime called sexual assault. If this happens, it is not your fault. Tell a friend, the police, or a trusted adult. You can also contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline sponsored by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) to talk to a counselor and find local organizations that can help. The hotline number is 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) and their website is www.rainn.org.

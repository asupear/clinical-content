# Lesson - Steps for Giving Constructive Criticism

## Screen 1
Here are some guidelines to help you use constructive criticism. Like any other skill, it will take practice to learn how to give criticism in an appropriate and effective way.

## Screen 2
First, **calm down**. Use your relaxation skills or take a time out if you are feeling angry or stressed. The heat of the moment is not the best time to talk about upsetting behavior, because you may not be in control of your emotions.

## Screen 3
**State the criticism in terms of how you feel and how the behavior affects you**. Focus on the problem not the person. Do not get stuck on the facts, because the other person may have another view of the situation. Choose your words carefully. An easy to use guide would look like this:

- When you ___________ (state the behavior)
- I feel ___________ (state how the behavior affects you)
- Because I ___________ (state how the behavior and the feelings are connected)
- Ask for what you need.

For example, "When you laugh at my question it makes me feel sad, because it seems like you're making fun of me or that you think it's a stupid question. I would appreciate it if you could please just answer my question."

## Screen 4
**Give the criticism in a calm but firm tone of voice**. Do not joke or laugh, because this will send the message that you are not serious or the issue is not important.

## Screen 5
**Direct your criticism at the person’s behavior**. It is important to remember to discuss the behavior and not personalize the situation by name calling or blaming. This will not solve the problem.

## Screen 6
Even though a person may be acting in a way that is displeasing, this does not mean that they are a bad person. It is important when giving criticism to a person not to imply that he or she is a total failure. For example, if your teenager does not clean his or her room, you would not call him or her "a big slob" or "a lazy kid". Remember to use the "I feel..." and "When you..." statements, such as, "I feel frustrated when you do not clean your room. We have friends coming over, and I don’t want the house to look messy."

## Screen 7
**Ask for a change of behavior**. Be specific in asking for what you want from the other person. Remember they may have no idea that you are unhappy with the way they are acting.

## Screen 8
**Be willing to negotiate**. You may not always get exactly what you ask for. Be open to giving a little in order to get your needs met. A compromise often sets up a win-win situation.

## Screen 9
**Start and finish the conversation with positive comments**. Others will be more apt to change behaviors if there are positive statements directed toward them. Remember that learning how to work out a problem can strengthen and improve relationships.

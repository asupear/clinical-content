# Lesson - Alcohol Use and Disulfiram Treatment

## Screen 1
Alcohol is the drug most commonly used or abused in combination with opioids. Many people who are addicted to opioids report that they often drink alcohol before, during, or after using opioids.

## Screen 2
Some opioid-dependent individuals say that they like the high they feel when using both alcohol and opioids.  They also say that alcohol helps them feel more relaxed and outgoing.

## Screen 3
Other opioid-dependent people report that they do not drink very often and that alcohol is not a problem.  Still others say they only drink when they use opioids, and some individuals report that they only use opioids when they are drinking.

## Screen 4
Alcohol use can be a problem that prevents people from successfully stopping their opioid use.  Disulfiram is a medication that can help control alcohol use.

## Screen 5
Disulfiram, also called Antabuse, is a medication that reduces the likelihood of alcohol use.   Disulfiram changes the way the liver breaks down alcohol. Drinking alcohol while on Disulfiram causes an unpleasant physical reaction.

## Screen 6
Symptoms that can result from using alcohol while taking Disulfiram can include:

- flushing
- rapid or irregular heartbeat
- dizziness
- nausea or vomiting
- difficulty breathing
- headaches

## Screen 7
This reaction can be dangerous for people with certain health conditions.  Disulfiram medication is available only by prescription, and can only be used when working with a doctor.

## Screen 8
Disulfiram must be taken under medical supervision.  Before the first dose of Disulfiram is given, it is important that medical staff find out about a person’s baseline levels on various physical measures, such as blood pressure and heart rate.  Then they can monitor these physical measures regularly for any serious changes from a person’s normal state.  This would alert them to any problems one might have when taking the Disulfiram.

## Screen 9
The procedure for starting Disulfiram consists of two main steps.  The first is education about Disulfiram therapy.  Next, if a person is interested in trying Disulfiram therapy, a plan will be developed.

## Screen 10
This section of the program will now explain how the Disulfiram therapy program works.

## Screen 11
Disulfiram comes in a pill that looks like an aspirin.   It is taken daily, and it usually has no effect on a person, unless they drink alcohol.  Drinking alcohol for up to 14 days after taking Disulfiram will cause the unpleasant symptoms that were previously described.

When it is taken, the Disulfiram pill is usually crushed up.  Then a small amount of water or juice should be added so it can easily be swallowed.

## Screen 12
Disulfiram can help a person refuse to drink alcohol because they know alcohol will make them sick.  It works by preventing the alcohol from being properly processed by the body.   That is, usually different chemicals in the liver digest alcohol.  These chemicals break down alcohol into a form the body can tolerate.  Disulfiram prevents this process from happening, which causes the unpleasant symptoms.

## Screen 13
Someone who drinks when they’re taking Disulfiram regularly will start to feel sick in about 5 minutes.  They will flush, become sick to their stomach, get sweaty, and their heart rate will speed up.   This reaction depends on how much they drink.  The more alcohol they drink, the worse the reaction will get.   Continuing to drink alcohol or drinking large amounts, such as four or five beers or shots, will probably make a person vomit and feel faint.

## Screen 14
Because the effects of Disulfiram can last up to 2 weeks after the last pill is taken, it can really help people who have mixed feelings about drinking or who tend to lose control of their drinking.  If a person had an urge to drink alcohol one day, just out of the blue or for some specific reason, Disulfiram can give them a reason not to drink.

## Screen 15
It is important for opioid dependent individuals who are learning how to live a drug-free lifestyle to remain abstinent from alcohol.  While alcohol may not be a major problem, it may interfere with efforts to stop opioid use.  Even small amounts of alcohol can increase the risk of opioid use.

## Screen 16
Taking Disulfiram shows a strong commitment to abstain from alcohol and opioid use.  Disulfiram may help build trust with family or friends, and can help them be more supportive.

## Screen 17
Disulfiram therapy can be used with other treatment strategies, like meeting with a counselor, setting goals around drinking, and making a plan.  In therapy, a person can discuss how they feel about drinking, what causes them to drink, and learn other ways to deal with problems.

## Screen 18
A therapist can discuss potential problems that a person may experience with taking Disulfiram regularly.  For example, there may be situations where a person feels like drinking and not taking Disulfiram, such as  a wedding, graduation, or special event.  These high-risk situations for alcohol use are sometimes hard to talk about, but they should be anticipated and worked out with a therapist.

## Screen 19
Taking Disulfiram at a regular time and place can help a person remember to take it every day.  Some suggested times to take it are before a meal, before bedtime, or at the same time that another medication is taken.

## Screen 20
It is very important that Disulfiram is taken on a daily basis.  A partner or roommate could help give reminders.  A therapist may set up a contract with a partner or roommate, so that if a person follows through with taking their medication every day, the other person will reward them in some way.  This could be as simple as verbal praise or doing a special activity together.

## Screen 21
If a person wants to stop taking Disulfiram, they should tell their doctor and/or therapist right away.

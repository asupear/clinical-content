# Lesson - Introduction to Relaxation Training

## Screen 1
This section of the program introduces effective relaxation techniques that you may use to cope with stress, tension, and anxiety.

## Screen 2
If a person does not cope well with stress or tension, that person can experience a variety of negative consequences. Examples of such consequences may include insomnia (difficulty sleeping), irritability, difficulty concentrating, heart problems, headache, overeating, smoking, getting into arguments, and impulsive behavior.

## Screen 3
Using alcohol or drugs is another possible negative consequence of difficulties in coping with stress and anxiety, which may further intensify one’s stress and anxiety.

## Screen 4
An important step in managing stress is to use stress as a signal to practice effective coping strategies, such as relaxation exercises, rather than as a signal to engage in unhealthy behaviors that are not effective in dealing with stress.

## Screen 5
It is important to recognize your stress signals or triggers of stress as early as possible, before they build up to the point where you become desperate to do most anything to get rid of the discomfort.

## Screen 6
When considering your stress signals, consider what thoughts, feelings, or physical signs your tension may signal. Examples may include thoughts such as, "I am going nuts over this work assignment - it’s really getting to me," or physical signs such as experiencing a tense feeling in your neck and shoulders.

## Screen 7
When you recognize these signals, there are a number of effective coping strategies you can use to reduce your tension.
Using relaxation techniques is one such strategy for effectively coping with stress.

## Screen 8
There are several ways that you can use relaxation to reduce stress:
a. To decrease tension you feel in specific stressful situations (e.g., nervous about an upcoming job interview, angry at the children, etc.)
b. To decrease your general level of daily tension
c. To decrease how tense you feel prior to going to sleep
d. To decrease the urge to engage in unhealthy behaviors like alcohol use
e. To increase your ability to think clearly and rationally in a problem situation (For example, when you are very angry or surprised by some unexpected event, it is easier to think positively if you are relaxed).

## Screen 9
The relaxation skills that you will learn in this program include two basic skills: reducing muscle tension and learning stress-reducing breathing exercises.

## Screen 10
At first you should not attempt to use relaxation to actually cope with stressful situations; simply focus on practicing the skills and exercises. Like any other skill, such as riding a bicycle, it becomes more useful and automatic only after a period of practice. Therefore, it is very important for you to practice relaxation techniques regularly so that you will eventually learn to use relaxation strategies to effectively reduce stress. After several sessions, you will be ready to begin using your relaxation skills to reduce stress in many everyday situations.

## Screen 11
Relaxation skills will be taught in three steps. First, you will learn to become more aware of tension and relaxation by tensing and relaxing eight specific muscle groups.

## Screen 12
Second, you will learn to "let go," or relax the eight muscle groups without tensing first.

## Screen 13
In the third step, through individualized planning, you will choose the relaxation techniques that work best for you. By that time, you should be able to relax a muscle group that you select (e.g., jaw, neck) rather than your whole body.

## Screen 14
You will learn these skills as you proceed through the relaxation training sections of this program.

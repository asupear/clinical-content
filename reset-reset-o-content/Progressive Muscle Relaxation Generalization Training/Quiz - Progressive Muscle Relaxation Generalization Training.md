Generalization training for relaxation involves relaxing those muscles that are not necessary for ongoing activities. For example, while sitting at the table and eating dinner, you can relax your forehead, shoulder, chest, and leg muscles. While standing and talking with someone, you can relax facial, shoulder, arm, and hand muscles. By relaxing muscles that are not required for an ongoing activity, you will be able to perform most daily activities with a reduced level of tension and a maximum level of comfort.

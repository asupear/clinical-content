# Lesson - Progressive Muscle Relaxation Generalization Training

## Screen 1
The ultimate goal of relaxation training is to learn how to control excess daily tension as it occurs in real life. Obviously, you will not be able to stop and run through a complete tense-relax procedure every time you notice muscle tension. Today this program will guide you through "letting go" of your muscle tension without tensing them first. After practicing in an upright position, you can use the "letting go" technique while standing, and during activities.

## Screen 2
Generalization training for relaxation involves relaxing those muscles that are not necessary for ongoing activities. For example, while sitting at the table and eating dinner, you can relax your forehead, shoulder, chest, and leg muscles. While standing and talking with someone, you can relax facial, shoulder, arm, and hand muscles. By relaxing muscles that are not required for an ongoing activity, you will be able to perform most daily activities with a reduced level of tension and a maximum level of comfort.

## Screen 3
To control excess tension as it occurs in real life, you must learn how to shorten the relaxation procedure so that you can use it conveniently in various situations. Two procedures that may expand your use of relaxation techniques to stressful situations are (1) letting go of muscle tension (e.g., focusing on "trouble spots"); and (2) steady breathing and reciting "Relax" or some other word that you have associated with relaxation. Initially, you should practice both procedures, but you may come to prefer one or the other.

## Screen 4
Relaxation through "letting go" uses the same eight muscle groups that you learned in a previous session. First, focus your attention on any tension you notice in those eight muscle groups. Then recall the feelings that you noticed when you released that tension during the tense-relax procedure. Then relax your muscles as completely as possible, releasing as much of their tension as you can.

## Screen 5
Begin by resting comfortably with your eyes closed. Just let go as best you can.

## Screen 6
Notice the feelings in your hands and forearms and let go of any tension there. Allow the muscles to relax and unwind. Relax the muscles in your hands and forearms further and further. Allow them to become more and more deeply relaxed.

## Screen 7
Notice the muscles in your upper arms. Allow them to smooth out, unwind, and relax, allowing any tension there to melt away, while noticing how it feels as the muscles become more and more deeply and comfortably relaxed.

## Screen 8
Now relax the muscles of your shoulders and neck, notice the warm, pleasant feelings of relaxation flowing into those muscles. Feel the muscles growing heavier as you let go further and further, becoming more and more relaxed. Notice the feelings of relaxation. Let all the tension go.

## Screen 9
Now notice the muscles in your face, beginning with your forehead and brow. Let your forehead loosen up, smooth out, and become relaxed. Enjoy the very pleasant feelings of relaxation. Let your eyes be lightly and comfortably closed, letting any tension or stress simply drift away. Allow your jaw to become relaxed, teeth separated. Notice the warm, comfortable feelings of relaxation spread throughout your face.

## Screen 10
Allow the relaxation to spread to your stomach muscles as you let go of any tension there. Notice the warm, pleasant feelings of relaxation flowing into those muscles. Feel the muscles growing heavier as you let go further and further, becoming more and more relaxed. Notice the feelings of relaxation. Let all the tension go.

## Screen 11
Notice the muscles throughout your legs, in your thighs, calves, and shins. Let go of any tension or tightness that you find there, letting the tension melt away, and enjoy the calm, peaceful feelings of relaxation flowing into your legs and down to your feet.

## Screen 12
As you continue to rest quietly, breathe slowly and steadily. Breathe deeply as you notice the sensations of relaxation. Take a deep breath and exhale very slowly. For the next few minutes, continue to breathe slowly and steadily, keeping your body completely relaxed, limp, and heavy. Each time you exhale, slowly and softly say the word "Relax" to yourself, or some other word that you have associated with relaxation. Imagine the word each time you exhale. Do nothing more than that for the next few minutes.

## Screen 13
Begin to apply your new skill in daily living. Start relaxing during relatively slow, non-stressful activities. Try relaxing, for example, while reading. Allow all muscles to relax except for the ones that you absolutely have to use for the activity. It is possible for you to be very relaxed while you:

- Watch TV, a movie, or a play
- Play cards, chess, checkers, or other table games
- Sit or talk with others
- Wait in line
-Ride a bus
-Drive

## Screen 14
Once you can relax during these slower activities, begin relaxing during some more demanding ones. For example, while:

- Shopping
- Doing housework
- Fixing your car
- Having a conversation while standing

## Screen 15
Eventually, you may use your relaxation skills during the fastest, most demanding activities you can think of. For example, while:

- Jogging (Yes, you can relax while you run - athletes do!)
- Running to catch a bus
- Standing in a crowded place
- Rushing to finish a project or assignment
- Playing tennis, football, or some other sport
- Talking to a very angry person
- Taking care of an emergency

## Screen 16
It is possible to relax and move rapidly. Athletes and dancers learn how to remain relaxed as they perform. If muscles unnecessary for your current activity are tense, those muscles will hinder the necessary muscles from performing well. For example, clenching your jaw and squeezing the steering wheel tightly while driving may cause a headache, which could distract you from concentrating on driving. As a result, you might get lost, or get into an accident. You may be wasting much of your energy on excess tension.

## Screen 17
For now, try using relaxation skills only while you engage in slow, non-stressful activities. Pay special attention to your specific "trouble spots" or muscles that tend to get particularly tense (e.g., jaw, neck, forehead, hands, etc.). With practice, you will find that you can use these relaxation skills while engaging in more and more demanding activities.

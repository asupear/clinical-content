# Lesson - Time Management

## Screen 1
In this section of the program you will learn some strategies you can use to plan, schedule, and prioritize the events and activities in your life.

## Screen 2
Some people say they don’t like to plan or they like to be spontaneous, but if they don’t find a way to schedule and organize their lives, they may eventually become overwhelmed and fail to achieve their goals. Therefore, it is important to learn time management skills because these skills can help you achieve your goals.

## Screen 3
The first step in learning to manage time is to make sure that you have an appointment book or planner.

## Screen 4
The next step is to establish a regular pattern of using the book every day to plan your schedule.

## Screen 5
Planning is usually done best first thing in the morning or at the end of the day.

## Screen 6
There are many advantages to planning in the morning when you are fresh. With the day’s priorities clearly in mind, you will be less likely to be sidetracked as you go along. Also, you can review any scheduled activities for the day.

## Screen 7
Alternatively if you decide to plan at the end of the day, this gives you the opportunity to consider what you have already accomplished that day and to plan your schedule for the next day.

## Screen 8
When planning your schedule, make a list of what you would like to accomplish on a given day. It is important that you make a separate "To Do" list each day. As you complete each activity, you should cross it off the list. Then, at the end of the day, you will be able to check on how many items you completed.

## Screen 9
It is important that your "To-Do" list be on a single piece of paper rather than jotting down items on miscellaneous scraps of paper. You should keep the list in your appointment book so it is accessible and useful.

## Screen 10
All the items on your lists may not be equally important and should be prioritized using the ABC system. To use this system, you write a capital "A" beside those items on the list that have a high value, a "B" for those with a medium value, and a "C" for those with low value. Items marked A should be those that yield the most value.

## Screen 11
You will get the most out of your time by doing the items marked A first and saving those marked B and C for later. By taking into account both the time of day and the urgency of the items, you can even break them down further so that A items become A1, A2, A3, and so on. How detailed you get depends on you and the number of activities on your list.

## Screen 12
You may also wish to plan your schedule for at least a week or even a month at a time, and as a result, you could make a separate "To Do" list for weekly and/or monthly goals. You will then need to prioritize items on those lists as you did for the items on your daily "To Do" list. Such lists will help you make small steps toward accomplishing your long-term goals.

## Screen 13
After prioritizing tasks, the next step in time management involves making realistic plans on when to complete each task on your list and entering each task into the calendar in your appointment book. The priority given to each item guides where and when you write each item in your schedule.

## Screen 14
Procrastination or putting of doing things that you have planned can prevent you from achieving your goals. It is very important for you to practice these time management procedures (daily scheduling and keeping daily lists) in order to effectively manage your time.

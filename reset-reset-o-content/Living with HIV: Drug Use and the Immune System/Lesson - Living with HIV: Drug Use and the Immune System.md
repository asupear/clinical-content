# Lesson - Living with HIV: Drug Use and the Immune System

## Screen 1
If you have HIV, it is important to take care of yourself as best as you can to ensure that your immune system stays as healthy as possible. As a person living with HIV, drug and alcohol use can affect your health and the progression of HIV in several ways.

## Screen 2
Research has shown that the use of drugs and large amounts of alcohol can affect how well the immune system works. Because HIV also causes the immune system to weaken, the use of drugs and alcohol by a person who has HIV may make it even harder to stay healthy.

## Screen 3
In addition to affecting the immune system, drugs and alcohol can make it harder for you to take your medications correctly. Drugs and alcohol can change the way you think, and may make it more likely that you could forget doses of medications, take too many doses, or take the medications at the wrong times. This can have serious effects on your health if the virus becomes resistant to the medications. Drugs and alcohol may also have negative interactions with the other medications you are taking, which could also threaten your health.

## Screen 4
If you use drugs you may also be putting yourself at risk for other viruses and infections. If you are using needles to inject or you snort a drug and you are sharing equipment, you may be at risk of becoming infected with hepatitis B or C, or with a strain of HIV that is resistant to medications. You may also be infecting other people with HIV.

## Screen 5
In addition, injecting drugs can also put you at risk for certain bacterial infections including tetanus (an infection that causes neck and jaw muscle spasms), blood poisoning (an infection of the bloodstream), botulism (which causes muscles to paralyze), and abscesses (infections under the skin). Especially because HIV makes it harder for your body to fight off infection, these infections can be very serious threats to your health and some can even be fatal if not treated.

## Screen 6
If you are using drugs and alcohol, you may also be more likely to have unprotected sex, putting yourself at risk for other sexually transmitted infections and putting your partners at risk of getting HIV from you.

## Screen 7
The best way to eliminate the risks and effects of drugs and alcohol on HIV and your health is to stop using. There are programs that can help you stop. For information about how to stop using drugs or alcohol, contact the national hotline for information and referrals to treatment sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The number is: **1-800-662-HELP (4357)**.

## Screen 8
If you do not stop using drugs and/or alcohol, use your own sterile drug equipment and never share it with others. If you are on HIV medications, talk to your health care provider about ways that you can stay on your medication schedule or whether it would be best to go off of the medications until you can stop using drugs and/or alcohol.

## Screen 9
People with HIV have the best chance of living long, healthy lives if they take very good care of themselves and see a health care provider regularly. You can help to increase the chances of staying healthy if you do not use drugs and/or alcohol.

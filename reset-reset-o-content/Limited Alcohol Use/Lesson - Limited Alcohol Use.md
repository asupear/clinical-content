# Lesson - Limited Alcohol Use

## Screen 1
Most treatment clinics recommend abstinence from all drugs, including alcohol. Many people who are in drug treatment programs do not want to give up their use of alcohol, even if there are good reasons for doing so. If you are in treatment and are unwilling to quit drinking alcohol, this session makes several suggestions that may help you be successful in treatment.

## Screen 2
If you are not willing to stop drinking alcohol, one alternative might be to try to reduce alcohol use or set goals for safe alcohol use. Your therapist can help you set appropriate goals and discuss self-control skills. You should try to make changes that will support your overall goal of drug abstinence.

## Screen 3
Examples of typical goals and strategies that can be used to reduce your alcohol use include limiting the amount of alcohol you drink and/or the number of days that you drink alcohol. For example, you may agree to cut down from five drinks per day to two drinks per day. If you drink four days per week, you may try to cut back to two days per week. These are changes in the right direction.

## Screen 4
Another strategy is to limit your drinking to safe settings. For example, only drink in your home or when someone is with you. Your spouse or a friend can help you if you start to drink more than you want to. If you are not drinking at home, make sure someone else can give you a ride when you need to leave the place where you have been drinking.

## Screen 5
Another way to control your drinking is to watch how much alcohol you drink, or have your partner or a friend keep track of this with you. Sometimes you might find that you lose count or do not notice how much you drink unless you pay close attention to this.

## Screen 6
Your treatment provider can provide a worksheet that can help you keep track of your alcohol use. Please ask your provider for this form or retrieve it from the packet you received at the start of treatment.

## Screen 7
Another approach is to sign a contract with your partner or a friend. Agree to reduce your alcohol use by a certain amount. In return, your partner or friend agrees to do something to reward you when you follow through with the agreement. This could be as simple as giving you verbal praise or doing a special activity with you.

## Screen 8
You may try these strategies and find that it is still hard to reduce your alcohol use. If you cannot meet your goals around alcohol use, it may be helpful to try a medication called Disulfiram.

## Screen 9
Disulfiram, often called Antabuse, is a medication that causes the body to have an unpleasant reaction to alcohol. This happens because it changes the way the liver handles alcohol. Disulfiram can help people who cannot control their alcohol use on their own.

## Screen 10
If you are unable to meet your reduction goals you should think about trying Disulfiram treatment. Your therapist can give you more details about Disulfiram. You can also learn more about Disulfiram in another section of this computer program.

# Lesson - Identifying and Managing Triggers for Risky Drug Use

## Screen 1
You may have noticed that in certain situations, it is harder to avoid using drugs.  These situations that can influence whether or not you use may include:

- The people you are with
- The place you happen to be
- The time and day
- How much money you have
- What else you are doing
- How you feel

## Screen 2
You may find that when you are with a certain group of friends who use together, it is really difficult to choose to not use.  If you have a lot of cash on you, you may find it difficult to choose not to spend it on drugs.

## Screen 3
The situations we just described are also known as triggers.  Triggers do not cause you to use; that is a choice that you make.  Triggers can, however, influence you and make it more likely that you will choose to use.  By understanding what your triggers or influences are, you can start to take control in these situations or try to avoid them altogether.

## Screen 4
Think of the last time that you used drugs.  Try to remember what you were doing just before you used.  Who were you with?  Where were you and what were you doing?  What were you thinking and feeling at the time?

## Screen 5
Now that you have identified the chain of events that surrounded your use, let’s think about how to manage these events differently, so that it is easier to choose not to use.

## Screen 6
One way to manage the situation is to avoid getting into it in the first place.  For example, if you were with a particular group of friends who use together, you could avoid hanging out with these friends.  This would mean that you might need to find a new place to hang out or a new group of friends who do not use.

## Screen 7
Another strategy is to rearrange your environment.  For example, don’t keep drugs or works in your home, and don’t carry money with you if you get tempted to buy drugs when you have cash on you.

## Screen 8
A third way to deal with triggers is to make a plan that will help you not use when you are in trigger situations.  For example, plan to buy yourself some new clothes or music, or put money into a savings account whenever you have extra cash.  Or if there is a certain time of day that you typically use, plan a different activity for that time that does not involve drug use, like playing a sport, going to the movies, or working.

## Screen 9
Think about the triggers you identified for yourself again, and think about some of the possible strategies you could use to manage the situation so that you don’t use.  Some of these strategies might not be realistic for you, but you should be able to find one or two that are.

## Screen 10
Once you have found some strategies that you think will work for you, try them out and practice managing yourself in real situations.  You can take control of situations that, in the past, increased the likelihood that you would use drugs.  It may not be easy, but it will get easier with practice and with support from other people who know your goals and can help you stick to your plan.

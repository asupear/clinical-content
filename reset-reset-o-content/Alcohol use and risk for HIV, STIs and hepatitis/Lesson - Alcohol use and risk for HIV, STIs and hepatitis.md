# Lesson - Alcohol Use and Risk for HIV, STIs and Hepatitis

## Screen 1
Alcohol has effects on the body and mind that may increase risk for HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and hepatitis.  Even if you have decided that you will not have sex or only have sex with protection (latex condoms, female condoms or latex dams), the use of alcohol can change the decisions that you make.

## Screen 2
It only takes a small amount of alcohol (one or two drinks) to reduce your judgment, self-control, and lower your inhibitions making it more likely that you will do things that you would not choose to do if you did not drink.

## Screen 3
After drinking alcohol, you may end up having sex when you did not plan to, or having sex without a condom or other barrier to protect against HIV, hepatitis and STIs.  If you drink a lot of alcohol all at once, you may even pass out or lose consciousness, making it possible for someone to take advantage of you sexually and potentially put you at risk.

## Screen 4
In addition to the effects of alcohol on the mind, it also changes the way your body works.  For people who already have HIV, alcohol can interact badly with some of the medications that treat HIV and can make it harder for the body to fight off illness.

## Screen 5
Alcohol can also cause damage to the liver.  For someone who has hepatitis C, the use of alcohol can make the liver damage caused by hepatitis much worse, potentially leading to liver failure.

## Screen 6
Alcohol also impairs your motor coordination, or your ability to control the movement of your body, your sight and your speech.  This can make it difficult to actually put a condom on if you want to use one.

## Screen 7
Watch this video to see how alcohol can make it much more difficult to use a condom, even if you plan to use one.

## Screen 8
The video may have been funny, but the real effects of alcohol on a person’s risk for HIV, STIs and hepatitis are not.  The best thing you can do to reduce alcohol-related risk for HIV, STIs and hepatitis is to choose not to drink.

## Screen 9
If you are planning to drink, try to limit the amount that you drink so that you can stay more in control, and make sure that you have latex condoms, female condoms, or latex dams with you.  It can also help to have a friend who knows your plan and your limits and who can help you stay on track.

## Screen 10
There can be a lot of pressure to drink from friends, and TV and movies can make it look cool, but it’s not.  People do really embarrassing and unhealthy, even life-threatening things when drinking, including having sex when they do not want to, or having sex without protection.

## Screen 11
It can be hard to say no if offered a drink.  The following are some quick and easy ways to say no to a drink without making a big scene.
FIVE WAYS TO SAY NO TO A DRINK

1.  No thanks.

2.  I don’t feel like it-do you have any soda?

3. Alcohol’s not my thing.

4.  I don’t do that anymore.

5.  Why do you keep pressuring me when I’ve said no?

## Screen 12
If you think that you have a problem with drinking or would like to learn about how to stop, there is a national hotline for information and referrals to treatment sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The number is: 1-800-662-HELP (4357).

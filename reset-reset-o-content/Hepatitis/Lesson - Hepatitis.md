# Lesson - Hepatitis

## Screen 1
Hepatitis is a group of diseases that affect the liver. The most common forms of hepatitis in the United States are hepatitis A, B and C. Hepatitis D and E are less common.

## Screen 2
Hepatitis A, B and C are all caused by viruses. Each virus is spread differently, and each one has different effects on the body. There are vaccines available to prevent infection with the hepatitis A and B viruses. There is no vaccine currently available for hepatitis C.

## Screen 3
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is found in the feces of people who have hepatitis A. It is usually spread from person to person by putting something in the mouth that has been in contact with the feces of someone with hepatitis A, or by eating raw or partially cooked shellfish that has been contaminated with hepatitis A. It can also be spread through oral-anal contact (rimming, or putting your mouth on someone else’s anus).

## Screen 4
People who have hepatitis A sometimes experience jaundice (yellowing of the skin and/or eyes) tiredness, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea and/or fever.

## Screen 5
Hepatitis A usually goes away on its own in a few weeks or months, and once you have had it, you can not get it again. It usually does not have any long-term effects.

## Screen 6
The best way to prevent hepatitis A is to get vaccinated. Other things you can do to prevent the spread of hepatitis A are to always wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, changing a diaper, and before preparing and eating food.

## Screen 7
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be transmitted through blood, semen, and vaginal fluids. It is spread during unprotected vaginal, anal and oral sex, through sharing needles and any other things that might have blood on them including razors, toothbrushes, and piercing and tattooing equipment. It can also be spread from mother to baby during birth.

## Screen 8
Hepatitis B causes inflammation (swelling) of the liver and damages liver cells. For most people who are infected, the virus clears from the body on its own within six months. For about 5% of infected people, it becomes chronic, or long-term.

## Screen 9
When hepatitis B becomes chronic or long-term, it can lead to scarring of the liver (called cirrhosis) and increased risk of liver cancer. The liver problems caused by Hepatitis B can lead to death. Drinking alcohol can make the liver disease worse.

## Screen 10
About 30% of people with hepatitis B have no noticeable symptoms. Those that do may experience jaundice (yellowing of the skin and/or eyes), fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and/or joint pain. There are medications that can treat chronic hepatitis B, but there is no cure.

## Screen 11
The best way to prevent hepatitis B infection is to get vaccinated, avoid the use of drugs and avoid sexual activity. If you do have sex, using condoms can reduce the risk of transmission.

## Screen 12
You can also prevent hepatitis B by not sharing personal care items that might have blood on them such as razors and toothbrushes. If you are getting a body piercing or tattoo, make sure that new, sterile equipment or tools are used for each person.

## Screen 13
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is transmitted through blood. Hepatitis C can be spread through the sharing of needles, syringes and other drug equipment or “works”, and through the sharing of razors, toothbrushes, tattoo and piercing equipment. It is rarely spread through sexual contact and from mother to baby.

## Screen 14
Hepatitis C causes inflammation of the liver. Some people with hepatitis C are able to clear the virus from the body, but most (about 75-85%) people with hepatitis C develop chronic or long-term infection.

## Screen 15
Of those with chronic hepatitis C, 70% develop serious liver disease. Hepatitis C infection is the leading reason for liver transplants and can also cause death. As with hepatitis B, drinking alcohol can make the liver disease worse.

## Screen 16
Most people with hepatitis C have no symptoms, but some have jaundice (yellowing of the skin and/or eyes), tiredness, dark urine, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and/or nausea. There are medications that can treat chronic hepatitis C, but there is no cure. Also, there is no vaccine for hepatitis C.

## Screen 17
The best way to prevent hepatitis C infection is avoid using drugs because needles, syringes, cookers, straws and other equipment might have blood on them.

## Screen 18
Avoid sharing personal care items like razors and toothbrushes, and make sure if you are getting a tattoo or piercing that new equipment or tools are used for each person.

## Screen 19
Hepatitis B and C are much easier to get than HIV because they are hardier and can survive outside of the body for a longer amount of time. They cannot be spread through casual contact such as hugging or shaking hands.

## Screen 20
It is estimated that over 80% of all injection drug users in the United States are infected with hepatitis C. There are blood tests that can be done by health care providers to tell if you have ever been infected with or are carrying one of the forms of hepatitis.

# Lesson - HIV and AIDS

## Screen 1
HIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV makes is hard for your body to fight off certain illnesses by attacking the immune system.

## Screen 2
When the immune system of someone infected with HIV gets so weak that they get one of a group of specific illnesses called opportunistic infections, then they are diagnosed with AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. AIDS-related illnesses can be very serious and are often fatal.

## Screen 3
A person with HIV can look and feel healthy for many years. Once infected, a person with HIV can pass the virus to other people, even if they do not look or feel sick and even if they do not know they are infected.

## Screen 4
Anyone can get HIV. HIV does not care if you are male, female, young, old, black, white, Latino, gay, straight, a drug user or if you have never used drugs. Currently 50% of all new HIV infections in the United States occur in people under the age of 25.

## Screen 5
HIV is primarily spread through unprotected sex and through sharing needles and other drug equipment. It can also be spread during pregnancy, birth or breast feeding from mother to baby. It is now very rare to get HIV from a blood transfusion because all donated blood and blood products are tested for HIV.

## Screen 6
The four body fluids that can transmit HIV are blood, semen (also called cum), vaginal fluid and breast milk. Saliva, urine and feces cannot transmit HIV, unless there is blood present. HIV is not spread through casual contact such as hugging, kissing, sharing eating utensils or public toilets.

## Screen 7
There is currently no cure for HIV or AIDS, but there are medications available that can help people with HIV and AIDS live longer, healthier lives. However, these medications do not help everyone, and many people have unpleasant side-effects from them such as nausea, diarrhea and fatigue.

## Screen 8
HIV is preventable. The best way to prevent getting or spreading HIV is to avoid having sex and avoid using drugs. If you do have sex, using condoms during sex can greatly reduce the risk of transmitting HIV. There is currently no vaccine to prevent HIV infection.

## Screen 9
Pregnant women who have HIV can greatly reduce the risk of passing HIV to their babies by taking anti-HIV medications and by not breastfeeding once the baby is born.

## Screen 10
The only way to know for sure if you have HIV is to get an HIV test. An HIV test looks for antibodies for HIV. Antibodies are something that your immune system makes to fight infection. It can take 3-6 months after someone is infected with HIV to test positive for the HIV antibodies. HIV tests can be done through a blood test, a test using a mouth swab, or a urine test.
